    "title": "Dispatch Took \"GTA 6 Amounts of Time\" To Make, But Season 2 May Not Take Nearly As Long",
    "description": "Dispatch feels like the kind of game that must have always been headed for success, having sold a million copies in just 10 days, and while it missed most of the awards season, it still landed on several best-of lists for the year. That impression hides a much rougher reality. Dispatch took years longer than expected, nearly collapsed more than once, and only made it out because the team managed to survive long enough to finish it. \"We're taking GTA 6 amounts of time on this shit,\" writer and co-founder Pierre Shorette says in an interview with Eurogamer, explaining why Dispatch Season 1 took so long to make. The episodic superhero workplace comedy spent close to seven years in development. The time spent wasn't about endlessly refining a hit, but about dealing with lost funding, shifting plans, and simple survival. The upside is that the groundwork is now done, meaning a potential Season 2 would not need anything close to the same amount of time. Game director Nick Herman is blunt about how close Dispatch came to ending. \"We had a publisher who dropped us halfway through because of … financial things,\" he says. Shorette places that moment in the context of the wider industry collapse. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

On December 22, Sega and Rovio will unleash Toho's iconic monster on Dr. Eggman's Toy World with a new stage: Godzilla Survival. The goal of that stage is simple. Players simply have to survive a Godzilla attack in the middle of the ocean while running from boat to boat. Trust us, you don't want to be stuck when Godzilla unleashes his atomic fire. Players will only get a single respawn on this stage, so run as if your virtual life depends upon it. Because it does. Sonic Rumble's free pass will unlock Godzilla and his fellow monster, Fire Rodan, without charging players. However, the premium pass will unlock Mothra and King Ghidorah, and it gives Godzilla his nuclear pulse ability in addition to his heat ray. The RSR Shop will also allow players to purchase Mecha Godzilla and his Absolute Zero blast as well as Destroyah and his Variable Slicer ability. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

After the live-service game failed to find an audience after launch in May 2023, Microsoft closed the studio a year later and ended most support for the game. Smith appeared on the My Perfect Console podcast recently and said (via Eurogamer), \"Every company makes the decisions they make for the reasons they make them.\" For Arkane Austin's closure, Smith said the \"shock\" was that Arkane--as a wider group that also comprised Dishonored studio Arkane Lyon--made well-received and commercially successful games.

But Howard declined that opportunity and all others. \"I think I'm best behind the camera,\" he said.
