Audio changes tested in a recent Battlefield Labs mini-test will be deployed with the upcoming update, with the overall aim to prioritize the most important combat and vehicle sounds. The audio refresh includes a \"comprehensive pass\" on footstep audio that aims to make footstep sound effects more tactically useful to players who can hear it. The update also includes some improvements towards ongoing performance issues that sometimes cause important sounds not to play as intended, an issue that's especially prevalent on large maps. Rush and Breakthrough are also getting some balance changes designed to improve the game mode's flow, and even out the win rate between attacking and defending teams. Seige of Cairo, for example, will get a few boosts to the attacking side, including one more attacker tank in Sectors 1 and 3, and an updated capture area on B. Rush attackers are also getting a small boost, with changes to M-COM locations on Manhattan Bridge and Liberation Peak. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Regardless, fans have noticed that Starry Studio, the developer behind Once Human, appear to have repurposed an asset from No Man's Sky as a premium cosmetic item. Now, Sean Murray--the head of No Man's Sky developer Hello Games--has weighed in on the similarity, even if he doesn't seem to be all that concerned about it. The similarities between No Man's Sky's base teleport module and Once Human's item were spotted by Reddit users, who noted that aside from the exercise bike and a fresh coat of paint on the latter, the two objects seem almost identical. Hey @NoMansSky @hellogames are you aware that @OnceHuman_ is selling your teams assets in game? @Gothalion https://t.co/tcjiInvEMC pic.twitter.com/UGrsVkMVeH — Atlas (@GenesisModding) December 1, 2025 Murray mentioned that both objects are missing rivets, which the Hello Games team accidentally left out of the model used when viewing the base teleport module from a distance. As far as Murray is concerned, \"[the] joke's on them.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Those waiting for the return of Diablo 4 leaderboards will have to wait a little longer, as the feature has been delayed into 2026. Blizzard announced the delay during its most recent Diablo 4 developer update livestream. The new leaderboard system revolves around a new dungeon called The Tower, where players will be able to test their builds and compete for clear times and rewards. \"This is to make sure we have some stability with the season launch, and then when The Tower shows up, it's online and people are ready to tackle it,\" associate game director Zaven Haroutunian said regarding the reason for the delay.

Tolkien's beloved fantasy novels. Published by William Morrow on October 14, The Hobbit &amp; The Lord of the Rings Illustrated by Alan Lee Box Set is on sale for nearly 50% off at Amazon and Walmart. Tolkien fans can secure this beautiful slipcased set for only $78.33 (was $150). If you're buying it as a Christmas gift, just know that Amazon currently estimates a delivery window of December 22 to January 5, whereas Walmart will deliver the box set next week. Though not nearly as fancy as last year's The Lord of the Rings Deluxe Illustrated Box Set, it's nice to have matching editions of LOTR and The Hobbit in one set. This is especially true when talking about the iconic editions illustrated by the conceptual designer of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit movie trilogies. The new four-volume collection includes redesigned editions of The Lord of the Rings Centenary Edition--published in 1992 to mark 100 year since Tolkien's birth--and The Hobbit 60th Anniversary Edition (1997).

And Walmart's sale happens to feature the best video game-inspired Lego set from Amazon's original sale: the Pac-Man Arcade. The 2,651-piece retro arcade cabinet model is on sale for $190 (was $270) at Amazon and Walmart while supplies last. Target actually matched this deal but has since sold out. Technically, the $190 price isn't the all-time low, because Amazon sold it for $189 over the weekend, but it's close enough.. The Pac-Man Arcade launched in June 2023 and almost always sells for full price. Most previous deals sold out fast, so it's somewhat surprising Amazon and Walmart aren't out of stock like Target.

But if you want to play that DLC, then you'll need to add the new Nightreign Version 1.03 patch across PC and consoles. One of the primary changes in this patch is that the trigger conditions for Relic effects have been broadened. The game's passive effects have been increased, which include greater attacking power when using two-handed weapons or armaments, as well as chain attacks, charge attacks, and jump attacks. The Wrath of Gold incantation has been given a power boost, while decreasing the cost to players' FP consumption. There are a number of bug fixes in this patch as well, including one that was teleporting players to the wrong area during the Augur invasion if they were performing a critical hit at the time. Under certain conditions, players weren't able to activate Sites of Grace or Churches, but the notes say the issue has been \"mitigated.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The third and final Metroid Prime 4 Amiibo, Sylux, is available to order for $30 at Amazon and other major retailers. Like other Amiibo released during the Switch 2 era, all three Metroid Prime 4 Amiibo are more expensive than collectors were used to before 2025. That's why it's refreshing to see Amazon restock the Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack for $25.31 (was $30). The Dread Amiibo set isn't difficult to find for around MSRP, but it's rare to see it sold by a major retailer. Usually you need to buy it from a third-party seller, but this restock is sold and shipped by Amazon. Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack $25.31 (was $30) The Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack is cool for multiple reasons. For Samus fans, it's one of the few collectibles featuring the bounty hunter's regenerating Varia Suit. The blue-tinged sections on the suit are organic matter from the Fusion Suit. This directly ties back to the events of Metroid Fusion. In the 2002 Game Boy Advance game, Samus was infected by the X parasite. She received the Metroid vaccine, but when Dread starts, her Varia Suit is still in the process of regenerating to its normal form. This Samus Amiibo is cool, but the E.M.M.I. Amiibo might be cooler. One of the most unsettling enemies in franchise history, the Extraplanetary Multiform Mobile Identifier--better known as EMMI--is robot nightmare fuel. Like Samus, the EMMI Amiibo's pose matches official key art. If Amazon sells out, you can buy the Metroid Dread 2-Pack from a third-party seller on Walmart Marketplace for roughly the same price.
