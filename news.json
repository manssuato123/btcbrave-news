    "description": "Humans aren't exactly on the top of the food chain in Squanch Games' High on Life 2. This first-person shooter takes place in a universe where aliens came to Earth to use humanity as ingredients for intergalactic pharmaceutical drugs. Now, a new trailer for the game facetiously markets itself to alien consumers as it encourages them to use Humanzapro, a new wonder drug made from humans. The trailer is done in the style of pharmaceutical ads that typically run on American TV. All of the tropes of those ads are present, including the footage of happy aliens after they've taken the drug. Intriguingly, the ad warns humans that they shouldn't be taking Humanzapro because of side effects. That makes us wonder if this particular drug will be a power-up during the game. High on Life introduced players to the Rick and Morty-esque talkative sci-fi weapons, which was fitting since the first game was produced by Rick and Morty co-creator--and Squanch Games co-founder--Justin Roiland, who also voiced a sentient alien weapon. Roiland was forced out of Squanch Games and Rick and Morty following a series of allegations. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The Real Ghostbusters: A Visual History Deluxe Edition $38.75 (was $65) See at Amazon The Real Ghostbusters: A Visual History Standard Edition $27.39 (was $55) See at Amazon The biggest movies of the '80s were regularly adapted into animated TV series, and Ghostbusters was no exception. Harold Ramis' supernatural comedy spawned The Real Ghostbusters, which ran from 1986 to 1991, and is still considered a beloved part of the franchise nearly four decades later. If you've ever wanted to explore the creation of the show, you can save a whopping 65% on The Real Ghostbusters: A Visual History thanks to Amazon's Cyber Monday sale. This deluxe book chronicles the cartoon series' production, with behind-the-scenes looks at the show's art and even its official toy line. The book is available in two versions, both of which are discounted: a Deluxe Edition for $38.75 (was $65) and a standard edition for $27.39 (was $55). Both discounts are limited-time deals that are only available during Cyber Monday. The Real Ghostbusters: A Visual History Deluxe Edition $38.75 (was $65) The Real Ghostbusters: A Visual History is a 248-page hardcover featuring behind-the-scenes content on the show. The deluxe version comes with several extras, including a slipcase inspired by the Ghostbusters Company 8 Firehouse headquarters, two replicas of animation cels, and a ribbon bookmark resembling the firehouse flagpole. As for the book, it's packed with creator interviews, original animation scans, toy photography, and much more. It examines how the show became a hit with audiences and led to the creation of a successful toyline that included some of the weirdest collectibles ever made. There's also never-before-seen conceptual artwork, storyboards, script excerpts, internal memos, packaging art, unseen prototypes, and abandoned concepts from the toy line. See at Amazon The Real Ghostbusters: A Visual History Standard Edition $27.39 (was $55) The standard edition of the book is also available at a 50% discount, but it doesn't come with any of the extra content listed above. Considering these books were released only in July, this is a significant overall savings for a relatively new release and a great idea for a Christmas present for the Ghostbusters fan at home. See at Amazon You can also pair this with The Real Ghostbusters animated series on DVD. While this isn't the full run of the cult-classic show, you're still getting over 100 episodes for just $18.49. You can also pick up the movies on Blu-ray, including recent releases like Ghostbusters: Afterlife and Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire. The classic films feature 4K remasters that substantially improve on the original Blu-ray releases, along with a treasure trove of special features.

The memorial venue was filled with heartfelt tributes, including copies of his games, artwork, swords, and pieces of his iconic clothing. Photos shared by attendees showed just how much he meant to the gaming community. Itagaki was a major figure in Japanese game development. He founded Team Ninja in the late 1990s and helped shape modern action and fighting games. At the memorial, Koei Tecmo executive Yosuke Hayashi shared memories of meeting him in 2001. Hayashi recalled being assigned to Itagaki's team and being told there was no work for him. 早矢仕洋介氏弔辞（コーエーテクモゲームス代表取締役社長執行役員CEO・コーエーテクモホールディングス取締役副社長）『板垣伴信をヴァルハラに送る会』にて#itagaki https://t.co/HPmFpDXixg pic.twitter.com/az4Y2lTve0 — 勝田 晴美 (@katsuta_harumi) November 28, 2025 \"I was assigned to your department as a game planner.

    "description": "In the 21 years since World of Warcraft launched, one feature has been asked about and requested above all others: player housing. Despite being the premier MMORPG for over two decades, housing in WoW has always felt like a pipedream. Now, that dream is finally a reality, as an early-access version of player housing is launching December 2 for those who preorder WoW's eleventh expansion, Midnight. It's been a long time coming. Housing as a feature was experimented with in WoW's earliest days but never came to fruition. In 2014, WoW's Warlords of Draenor expansion gave players a taste of what a full-fledged player housing system could be in the form of Garrisons. These large, base-like personal towns met nearly all of a player's needs in one location. But Garrisons quickly became more of a lesson in what Blizzard shouldn't do when it came to player housing. Barely customizable, Garrisons were also extremely isolating. With access to so many amenities in one, private location, players didn't need to be out in the world or hanging out in one of WoW's capital cities. Garrisons whetted players appetites for housing, but whenever Blizzard was asked about when a proper housing system might arrive, it always replied that it wanted to do the feature justice and was waiting for the right moment to make it happen.
