Mega Lucario Z marks the game's first Z Mega Evolution--a new kind of Mega-Evolved form that has a shorter cooldown period, but depletes Mega Energy much more quickly. According to the official Pokemon website, \"Pokemon that undergo Z Mega Evolution require less time to fire off moves after receiving the orders from their Trainer, but they also burn through their Mega Power very quickly, making them less suited for long battles.\" Like the original Mega Lucario, Mega Lucario Z is a steel and fighting type. Where this form differs, however, is in its defense and speed stats. As the official Pokemon website explains, \"While Mega Lucario concentrates its aura into a destructive force, Mega Lucario Z uses it to surround its entire body, cloaking itself to increase its defense, flexibility, and agility.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

He argues that AI is already integrated into many aspects of game development, from asset production to testing tools, and that its impact will only intensify. In an interview with The Game Business, Mahoney explains that the AAA sector is facing what he bluntly calls an \"end-of-days\" moment. Costs are skyrocketing, development cycles are slowing, and publishers are becoming increasingly risk-averse, adding that the industry often misunderstands where value truly comes from. Responding to examples of failed studios with prestigious founders, Mahoney says, \"The examples that you just gave were, 'We bought this company because five years ago they made some game. So, therefore they're good.' It doesn’t work that way at all,\" and insists that the \"game companies are really just collections of people.\" He believes that success depends on understanding their motivation and creative drive, not past hits.

The same report also suggested that Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson is not going to get the job. It was previously reported that Disney's board considered external candidates to take over for Bob Iger, including Wilson. But the new report said Disney is likely to choose an internal candidate. Wilson, for his part, is staying on with EA amidst the company's $55 billion sale. The new Disney CEO could be D'Amaro, who is currently the current head of Disney Experiences--a sprawling unit that covers theme parks, consumer products, cruise ships, and video games. The WSJ report said D'Amaro--who is \"widely considered\" to be named the next CEO--wants to give video games \"a bigger role at the company.\" The report said D'Amaro is also looking to integrate \"gaming technology\" into Disney's creative processes. No further details were divulged, however. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
