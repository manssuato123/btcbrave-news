However, Straley essentially left the game industry for several years despite that impressive track record. Now, Straley is sharing more details regarding his departure, following up on comments he made years ago. \"I had been there 18 years.

    "title": "How Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Fails The Genre Nintendo Created",
    "description": "New Metroid games are few and far between, so the launch of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond should have been a monumental event for the fanbase. Instead, eight years after its announcement, and 18 years after the previous game, Nintendo’s big December 2025 release landed with a loud thud. Already, this once highly anticipated title is poised to be one of the series' most divisive games, earning a spot alongside Other M and Federation Force. This isn't for lack of polish, as Prime 4 is indeed visually stunning and perhaps the greatest first-party showcase of graphics on the Nintendo Switch and its successor. But while it has its share of enthusiasts, it’s difficult not to feel underwhelmed by the final product in comparison to prior Prime games and even other, similar entries in the Metroidvania space that has grown in Nintendo’s frequent absence. The list of Metroidvania games from independent and third-party developers in the past decade alone is astonishing, with Ori and the Blind Forest, Axiom Verge, Hollow Knight, Dead Cells, Animal Well, and others throwing new concepts and innovations into the genre’s well of ideas. Hollow Knight and its follow-up, Silksong, have captivated players with their dense worldbuilding, roaming NPCs, and optional side objectives, all of which have come to define the critically acclaimed series. Nine Sols stood out with its intricate combat system, while more out-there games like pinball Metroidvania Yoku’s Island Express have proven anything can be a Metroidvania with the right amount of determination and creativity. Even Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown changed the game with something as simple as an in-game screenshot system to help with backtracking. The Metroidvania genre is rapidly iterating with a volume of unique takes. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

While last night's announcement trailer at The Game Awards 2025 was surely exciting for Knights of the Old Republic fans, the truth is that the game, led by original KOTOR and Mass Effect director Casey Hudson, is in a very early stage of development. According to the official Star Wars website, Hudson's new studio, Arcanaut Studios, was formed just this year, after his previous studio closed in November 2024. The studio's careers page contains listings for several senior-level positions, so the announcement trailer also doubles as a recruitment advertisement, a tactic that developers often employ. With the lengthy development cycles that high-profile games undergo these days, we're probably years away from seeing anything concrete from Fate of the Old Republic, and even further from a release. Skepticism about the game even releasing this decade is quite reasonable. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "IWGB Union Says Rockstar's Statement Is Filled With \"Disinformation\" Over Fired Developers",
    "description": "The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has shot back at Rockstar Games regarding the firing of 30+ staffers, saying that the company's latest statement is \"littered with falsehoods and disinformation.\" IWGB released a statement clarifying its take on Rockstar Games' justification for terminating the 30+ UK and international employees in October 2025. Parent company Take-Two Interactive explained that the GTA developer fired those workers for \"gross misconduct, and for no other reason.\" More specifically, Rockstar Games told GameSpot that those developers were let go for discussing \"specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles\" and other \"confidential information\" in a public forum. IWGB took issue with that, telling GameSpot that the characterization is inaccurate. \"Rockstar's latest statement is littered with falsehoods and disinformation--they have given multiple, conflicting reasons to explain why the workers were fired, as if attempting to reverse engineer a rationale for the dismissals,\" the union said in an emailed statement. \"Once again, they have chosen to mischaracterise workers speaking about their working conditions in a private forum as 'leaking information.' It is hard to understand this statement as anything but a desperate attempt to deflect from the global scrutiny they have come under over the last month. From the UK Prime Minister in the House of Commons, to the game developers across the world erupting in protest--all eyes are on Rockstar and their lawless attack on the people who make them their billions.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Winter doesn't technically arrive until December 21, but Fanatical is getting a jump on the season with its Winter Sale 2025. Like all sales at the retailer, you'll find hundreds of PC games available for cheap--almost all of which are offered as Steam keys. Some high-profile titles are on sale, including some of 2025's best like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Elden Ring: Nightreign, as well as discounts for upcoming titles like Crimson Desert and Resident Evil Requiem. Along with the discounts, customers can also unlock a free Winter Bonus Drop when spending over $15 on a single order. This could be anything from a free game to a discount coupon. See all deals at Fanatical If you happened to miss The Game Awards, all you really need to know is that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 walked away with pretty much every trophy. And if you still haven't jumped into the story-rich RPG, you can pick it up for just $36 (was $50). No doubt it's an iconic game, and we'd contend it's worth purchasing even at full price--it was GameSpot's Game of the Year, after all. So at $36, it's hard to pass up. Along with a memorable cast of characters and a fantastic story, its tense, turn-based combat offers plenty of flexibility thanks to some real-time mechanics and dozens of ways to customize your party. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II was also at The Game Awards, and right now you can add it to your Steam library for $36 (was $60). It's a remarkable improvement over the original, and it's a sprawling open-world action RPG that gives you good reason to stay inside during the winter. A similar open-world RPG option that's a bit cheaper is Dragon's Dogma 2, as it's $25.19 (was $70). It doesn't have a traditional fast travel system, but that only means you'll have more time to wander its gigantic open world overflowing with dynamic encounters and side-quests.
