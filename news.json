But just two days after its latest win, The Indie Game Awards stripped Expedition 33 of its two wins over the developer's use of AI. \"The Indie Game Awards have a hard stance on the use of gen AI throughout the nomination process and during the ceremony itself,\" reads a statement on The Indie Game Awards' official site (via Insider Gaming). \"When it was submitted for consideration, representatives of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. In light of Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from its nomination.\" Following that decision, The Indie Game Awards named Blue Prince as its new Game of the Year. Sorry We're Closed was given the award for Debut Game, which Expedition 33 previously claimed. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Despite Netflix announcing a deal with Warner Bros. Discovery to acquire the media and entertainment behemoth, Paramount has not given up on its own attempt to acquire the company by going directly to shareholders. Now, Paramount has announced that it has further sweetened its proposal in a bid to make a deal. Paramount, which is run by David Ellison, has offered an \"irrevocable personal guarantee\" from his father, billionaire Oracle founder Larry Ellison, of $40.4 billion. Additionally, Paramount announced that it would increase and match Netflix's fee of $5.8 billion to be paid to WBD if the deal gets struck down in the regulatory process. Paramount's previous breakup fee was $5 billion. What's more, Paramount said its revised proposal includes \"further improved flexibility to WBD on debt refinancing transactions, representations, and interim operating covenants.\" The updated offer also includes the publishing of records that show the Ellison family trust owns 1.16 billion shares of Oracle stock, which is an attempt to show WBD shareholders that the Ellisons can indeed finance their $40.4 billion of the proposed $108 billion all-cash offer.

Studio co-founder Jeremy Stieglitz revealed a two-year roadmap for Ark: Survival Ascended, which will culminate with the release of Legacy of Santiago, a major expansion that will lay the groundwork for Ark 2 and introduce several new gameplay mechanics coming to the sequel.
