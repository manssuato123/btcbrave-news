    "description": "In January 2026, it will be seven and a half years since the announcement teaser for The Elder Scrolls 6. In that time, Bethesda has had remarkably little to say about it or even a trailer to show off. Now, Bethesda's Todd Howard has indicated that most of the Bethesda team is working on The Elder Scrolls 6. \"It's progressing really well,\" Howard told Game Informer. \"The majority of the studio's on [Elder Scrolls 6]. but I'll say this: We always overlap. So, we're very used to overlapping development. And we have long pre-productions on things so that we feel good about them. And it's a process. We all wish it went a little bit faster--or a lot faster--but it's a process that we want to get right.\" Although the initial announcement came years ago, it's possible or even likely that development didn't ramp up on The Elder Scrolls until after Starfield was released in 2023. Fans are so desperate for any kind of update that they're reading things in the Skyrim Switch 2 announcement trailer as if they're hidden hints about an Elder Scrolls 6 release window.

    "description": "Total War: Warhammer 40,000's four asymmetrical factions will vary wildly from one another, as developer Creative Assembly has now outlined how some of the game's factions will play and be \"totally different\" from factions seen before in the Total War franchise. After being announced during The Game Awards, more details about developer Creative Assembly's next game have been revealed via a new developer roundtable. The four factions players will have to choose from include Space Marines, Astra Militarum, Orks, and Aeldari. Mann said the universe has a lot of opportunities for asymmetry between the factions, and Creative Assembly knew that it could only pick a limited number of playable factions in order to give each one the amount of effort to make them feel special. In terms of how they play, each faction will field troops, gather resources, and engage in battle in different ways. Of the four factions, Astra Milatrum is said to be the most \"traditional\" Total War faction, with mass ranks of infantry and support from artillery and vehicles. Like in other Total War games, Astra Militarum players will need to gather resources, build infrastructure, and recruit more troops in order to succeed. In true Astra Militarum fashion, solving problems will often mean throwing more masses of bodies at it. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Arc Raiders A Toxic Trail Quest Guide",
    "description": "Arc Raiders has a whole lot of quests, and one set of them requires you to do some digging on who has contaminated the water supply. This questline eventually leads to A Toxic Trail, which sends you back to a previous location to figure out more about what's going on with the water. In this guide, we'll tell you how to complete A Toxic Trail. You don't necessarily need to extract from the map to complete A Toxic Trail, but it's not a bad idea to do so, especially if you don't have a safe pocket for the key that drops at the end of the quest. While it's not required for any quests, it can help you find some good loot on the Spaceport map later. When you're ready to tackle A Toxic Trail, read on for each step you'll need to complete.

For starters, Activision has launched a new week-long free trial for Black Ops 7's multiplayer mode. In the free trial, which runs December 16-22, players can access 20+ maps and try the Ashes of the Damned map for Zombies. In terms of modes, players can try out mainstays like Team Deathmatch, Hardpoint, Domination, and Kill Confirmed, as well as the Holiday Havoc mode and Prop Hunt. Alongside this, Activision has discounted Black Ops 7 by up to 30%. This brings the price down to from $70 to $49 for the standard edition, or from $100 to $80 for the Vault Edition.

One of the longest-running and highest-rated of these is Rosetta Stone. The service offers comprehensive courses in 25 languages, all of which use a unique immersion learning style, making it one of the most effective language learning programs out there. Of course, as with any language-learning program, the trick is to stick with it--luckily, Rosetta Stone is offering a limited-time discount on lifetime subscriptions, dropping the price to just $149 (was $400), which could make it much easier to commit to the process. While the Lifetime Subscription is arguably the best deal, it's not the only Rosetta Stone discount. The 3-Month Plan is on sale for $48 (was $60; billed every three months), while the 12-Month Plan is $126 (was $240; billed every 12 months). While the Lifetime Plan includes all 25 languages (listed below), monthly plans only unlock a single language--making the lifetime subscription by far the best deal. All plans offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. Rosetta Stone also lets you gift plans to others, which could make this deal a fun holiday gift. Here's a look at all the options side-by-side: Rosetta Stone Subscription Discounts Lifetime Plan -- $149 ($400) (single payment) | Includes 25 languages 12-month plan -- $126 ($240) (billed annually) | Includes one language 3-month plan -- $48 ($60) (billed every 3 months) | Includes one language See plans at Rosetta Stone Rosetta Stone's deals are only available for a limited time, so be sure to sign up at these discounted rates before they disappear.

    "title": "How Horses' Ban Reflects The Gaming Industry's Double Standards And Emotional Immaturity",
    "description": "A tectonic shift in the political climate has given rise to a sharp increase in authoritarian practices and policies and made 2025 an unprecedented and disconcerting year for censorship, including for the video game industry. In the face of outstanding pressure on the payment processors powering storefronts like Steam and Itch, thousands of games--largely pertaining to adult subject matter that was sexual in nature and labeled NSFW--were either removed or deindexed from those respective stores. Though the uproar around these removals died down with time--partly due to loss of momentum pressuring these stores to rescind the bans, partly because certain free games were eventually reindexed on Itch--the recent release of Santa Ragione's Horses has brought the conversation back for another round before year's end. That's because, once again, a title with a significant amount of adult content (seriously, Horses fits a lot of taboo material into a fairly brief runtime) has found itself in the crosshairs of the ongoing puritanical culture war that's raging throughout the country, as well as in the world of video games. And as it continues, the controversy around certain games and their subject matter begins to raise questions about artistic expression, who in this medium is allowed to discuss and prominently feature adult-oriented content, and what kind of conversations and explorations of these subjects will the corporate powers in control of the industry permit. Horses is a notable development in this ongoing controversy for several reasons, not the least of which is the preventative measures taken against it. Whereas the bulk of the censorship mentioned here came well after games were released and available to play, affecting many games that had already been listed on these stores for some time, Horses has been facing an uphill battle leading to its release on December 2.

One of these quests, The Clean Dream, asks you to begin by searching containers and monitoring a filtration system before sending you off to a whole new map. If you're looking to tackle this quest, we've got everything you need to know below. Table of Contents [hide]Search 4 containers in the underground tunnels Search 4 containers in the underground tunnels First, you're headed to Spaceport to search four containers in the underground tunnels. These tunnels run all along the center of the map, and there are a variety of ways to get down there and navigate them. However, the most common and easily-accessible entrance will be the same spot you visited during the Switching the Supply quest, which is a collapsed section a bit southwest of the Launch Tower. This is the best entrance to the tunnels for most players.While you're down here, you can search any lootable container--including \"breach &amp; search\" boxes--to complete this part of the quest. Even if something has been opened and searched by another raider, you'll get credit for searching it yourself. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
