    "title": "Arc Raiders Is My Game Of The Year, But Its Use Of Generative AI Really Sucks",
    "description": "These past two months with Arc Raiders have been the most fun I've had with games all year. It represents the most exciting and unpredictable multiplayer landscape I've jumped into since Sea of Thieves in 2018, which I consider my favorite game ever made. It's safe to say I really love Arc Raiders. But it's become difficult to fully espouse those feelings as we learn about Embark Studio's use of generative AI. According to the studio, Arc Raiders' voice acting was initially performed by humans, then used to \"train\" AI so that it could speak in the actors' voices while addressing any possible circumstance. For Embark, the team doesn't need to bring in the voice actors each time new content is added to the game. The AI voices learn to speak in the voices of the actors, which the actors are said to have agreed upon when they were hired, and the tools take it from there. Maybe it shouldn't have come as a surprise, since the team's previous game, The Finals, uses generative AI in a similar way. In an interview, Embark assured players that the game's visual artwork is entirely human-made, but admitted to using this text-to-speech training to bring voices to the game's shop NPCs, emotes, and other character barks. Knowing this has left me conflicted when I think to sing the game's praises. On one hand, I can't deny the hold Arc Raiders has taken over me. The heart wants what the heart wants, and Embark's extraction shooter, rich in emergent, player-driven drama, has lit my heart on fire in a way few games ever have. At the same time, I've already written my review. Though it was a glowing one that I don't regret, I also feel it's my job to call out this disappointing practice. In recent weeks, similar practices or plans have arisen in several high-profile examples. Larian Studios' boss vouched for it in some cases. Nexon's former CEO said AI is about to rewrite everything in the games industry. Ubisoft announced it's using an AI tool to help write its games in some instances. Even Hideo Kojima, often considered a unique voice in the industry, says he uses it at times. It's being presented as not just helpful, but inevitable. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

According to Aspyr, the response has been so strong that more Tomb Raider games may make the leap to Switch 2. Aspyr product manager Jordon Reese was recently asked by Nintendo Everything about the possibility of the other Survivor trilogy games--Rise of the Tomb Raider and Shadow of the Tomb Raider--coming to Switch 2. Reese didn't directly confirm those titles, but he also seemed to leave the door open for them. \"We've successfully brought back the classic era [Tomb Raider 1-6] and now the origin story of Lara Croft to modern Nintendo platforms,\" said Reese. \"We can't announce anything at the moment, but the passionate response to this release is strong encouragement for us to continue exploring those possibilities.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The actor, Maxence Cazorla, is saying this against the backdrop of only one person, voice actor Charlie Cox, being nominated for Best Performance at The Game Awards for the role of Gustave. For what it's worth, Cox was open in acknowledging that Cazorla deserved credit, too, and Cazorla said Cox was kind to say that. Cox did not end up winning Best Performance, as it was Jennifer English as Maelle from Expedition 33 who took home the award. In any event, Cazorla told Eurogamer that he believes a \"Best Character category feels more logical\" than \"isolating a single performer and potentially leaving others invisible.\" Whether or not this is something that host and organizer Geoff Keighley is considering for next year's The Game Awards is unknown.

Normally $500, the console bundle is discounted to $450 as a last-minute holiday deal. This promotion could expire at any time. There's another possible reason why this Cyber Monday deal has returned at major retailers. According to an internal GameStop memo shared by Nintendeal, the bundle is no longer in production. This isn't a surprise, as Nintendo originally stated the bundle would only be available until Fall 2025. In any case, this could be your last chance to not only save on the bundle, but buy it from a major retailer in general. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "If you find yourself with a shiny new Meta Quest headset during the holidays, be sure to check out the new Winter 2025 Edition of Fanatical's Build Your Own Quest VR Bundle deal. Like other Fanatical deals, you choose from a catalog of 21 games (all of which are offered as official keys for your Quest), and the more you buy, the more you'll save. Buy two or more games to get each for $9, four or more for $8.75/each, and seven or more for $8.50/each. If you want, you can add 21 games to your bundle, in which case you'll pay $178.50--while that's higher than most Fanatical bundle deals, it's still a massive 65% savings compared to the bundle's $471.79 value. See deal at Fanatical As for the games in the bundle, if you're a fan of Superhot, take a peek at Chronostrike. The stylized shooter emphasizes cooperative play, tasking you and a buddy to take down hordes of foes while deflecting bullets, manipulating time, and making liberal use of your environment to your advantage. There are also more traditional shooters like Contracts Shadow: ExfilZone. Fans of dark fantasy dungeon crawls should check out Amid Evil VR, which offers a frantic melee adventure with classic Quake-style movement and level design. For something more strategic, check out Neon Squad Tactics. The top-down, turn-based, cyberpunk tactics game lets players choose from nine unique characters and fight across 31 maps. Meanwhile, 7th Guest VR and Shadow Chambers are great picks for more immersive, puzzle-filled adventure games. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Microsoft has reacted to a report that said the company is pushing Xbox to make more profit. In a statement to CNBC, the company said it has ambitious profit goals, but the specific 30% profit-margin figure was not correct. The statement was paraphrased and not attributed to any specific person at Microsoft, and GameSpot has followed up with Microsoft in an attempt to get more information. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Microsoft pushed the Xbox team to increase profit margins starting in 2023, with the goal of rising to 30% (up from 12% in 2022). The industry average for profit margins is likely between 17% and 22%, analysts said in the Bloomberg piece. According to the report, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood implemented the new goals, and her team has \"taken a larger role\" in the company's gaming business recently. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
