That may be why the official Gears of War social media accounts have shared a message assuring fans that E-Day is still coming in 2026. The image shared on the Gears of War X account didn't share any spoilers and it was just a skull set against some haunting red and black shades. But it did confirm the 2026 release window. Emergence Begins. 2026. pic.twitter.com/7rayOKYEL9 — Gears of War (@GearsofWar) December 12, 2025 For now, Gears of War: E-Day is only confirmed for Xbox Series X|S and PC. However, it seems very likely to be the second game in the franchise to make the leap to PlayStation 5, given that Gears of War: Reloaded--a remake of the original game--became the first title in the series to appear on a Sony console. Cliff Bleszinski--the co-creator of the franchise--has mentioned that he's happy that the Gears of War games are no longer exclusive to a single console. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has shot back at Rockstar Games regarding the firing of 30+ staffers, saying that the company's latest statement is \"littered with falsehoods and disinformation.\" IWGB released a statement clarifying its take on Rockstar Games' justification for terminating the 30+ UK and international employees in October 2025. Parent company Take-Two Interactive explained that the GTA developer fired those workers for \"gross misconduct, and for no other reason.\" More specifically, Rockstar Games told GameSpot that those developers were let go for discussing \"specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles\" and other \"confidential information\" in a public forum. IWGB took issue with that, telling GameSpot that the characterization is inaccurate. \"Rockstar's latest statement is littered with falsehoods and disinformation--they have given multiple, conflicting reasons to explain why the workers were fired, as if attempting to reverse engineer a rationale for the dismissals,\" the union said in an emailed statement. \"Once again, they have chosen to mischaracterise workers speaking about their working conditions in a private forum as 'leaking information.' It is hard to understand this statement as anything but a desperate attempt to deflect from the global scrutiny they have come under over the last month. From the UK Prime Minister in the House of Commons, to the game developers across the world erupting in protest--all eyes are on Rockstar and their lawless attack on the people who make them their billions.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Producer Andrew Willis noted how important it is for workers to fight back against the injustices facing the games industry at the moment. \"The wall-to-wall organizing effort at id Software was much needed; it's incredibly important that developers across the industry unite to push back on all the unilateral workplace changes that are being handed down from industry executives,\" Willis said. \"The union is a way for us, the developers, to take back control of the industry we love and to ensure that it delivers high-quality products from high-quality workers who have health benefits and longevity beyond quarterly profits.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Xbox Boss Highlights PlayStation Success, Talks Bringing Halo To PS5",
    "description": "One of the biggest surprises of 2025 was Microsoft's push to bring even more of its games to PlayStation, its longtime rival in the console gaming space. Not only have those ports been well received, but they've also been best-sellers, and next year will see the arrival of Halo and Forza Horizon on PlayStation. In a new interview, Microsoft's president of game content and studios, Matt Booty, spoke about the success of Xbox games on PS5 and the reaction to Halo's announcement for PS5. \"We had a bit of a moment earlier in the summer from end of April to end of June, where we had six of the top 10 games on PlayStation were our Xbox games,\" Booty said to Variety. \"I look at that as validation for the teams, but most importantly, it's an opportunity for more players to engage with our content, to come into our worlds.\" Halo has long been considered the crown jewel of Xbox, and the next game in the franchise, a campaign-only remake of the original titled Halo: Campaign Evolved, will launch simultaneously on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 in 2026. Booty said the announcement was well received and that Microsoft was really pleased with its efforts to bring its content to more people. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "This hasn't been the best year for Call of Duty, with sales for Black Ops 7 faltering compared to 2024's Black Ops 6. Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty touched on this year's installment of the military shooter series, and although he didn't address sales numbers directly, he did acknowledge the hardships of the franchise's annual model. Speaking to Variety, Booty said that \"shipping a major franchise like clockwork every year is a really difficult task, and I’m really proud of what the team did to move the franchise forward in that way.\" A new Call of Duty game has been released every year since the franchise's beginning in 2003, and it doesn't appear that Xbox-owned publisher Activision will stop this pattern any time soon. The only change to the release model is that the series will no longer release back-to-back installments of the same subseries, as Modern Warfare and Black Ops have both done.

    "description": "A movie based on Activision's Call of Duty series is in the works now at Paramount, which is now led by billionaire and Call of Duty superfan David Ellison. Prolific writer and director Taylor Sheridan is writing the script for the film, with Lone Survivor director Peter Berg attached to direct. Activision had been trying to make Call of Duty movies for years, so why is it finally happening now? Xbox boss Matt Booty told Variety that \"a relationship came about\" between people at Paramount and senior executives working on Call of Duty. \"They felt like they found a partner who understands the game, people who play the game, and shared a vision of what it could be to bring that forward,\" Booty said. Activision originally announced it would make Call of Duty movies through its Activision Blizzard Studios label that was formed in 2015, led by Hollywood producers Stacey Sher and Nick van Dyk, and charged with adapting Activision Blizzard's franchises for film and TV. A Call of Duty movie universe was planned at one point, but, as often happens in Hollywood, nothing ever happened. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
