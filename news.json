These bonus materials all originally aired on HBO, but the Blu-ray does include two exclusive special features: Ellie's Ultimate Revenge explores Ellie's motivations throughout Season 2 and Beneath the Surface: The Visual FX of The Last of Us offers a closer look at how the world around the characters was created with props and grisly special effects.

The Last of Us Part 2 was already a good-looking game when it first debuted on PS4, but the PS5 version makes it look even better. The remastered version includes the original game and adds visual upgrades and levels featuring behind-the-scenes commentary from Naughty Dog developers. Additionally, you can explore three \"Lost Levels\" that weren't included in the game, test your skills in the roguelike survival mode No Return, and strum a few chords in Guitar Free Play mode.

    "description": "1TB SSDs $70 - $130 See at Amazon 2TB SSDs $135 - $190 See at Amazon 4TB SSDs $240 (was $328) See at Amazon Solid-state drives (SSDs) have come a long way over the years, evolving from expensive storage devices into affordable upgrades for PCs and consoles. For Black Friday, SSDs from various manufacturers are on sale, with a wide range of capacities available. Considering that modern-day video games require more storage space than ever before, a storage capacity is an essential purchase for PC and console players--and grabbing one while they're on sale is a great opportunity to add a terabyte or four to your devices at more affordable price points. To help you find the best deals, we've rounded up a selection of discounted SSDs in the lists below. You'll find models that work on PC and PS5, as well as proprietary storage card expansions for Xbox Series X, and MicroSD cards for Switch, Switch 2, and Steam Deck. We've also thrown in a few SSD heatsinks and external drive options as well. Note that these are all limited-time deals, so pricing and availability may change. Once you've browsed all the SSD drives below, check out GameSpot's Black Friday Deals Hub for the latest discounts on hardware, video games, Blu-rays, and more. 1TB SSDs $70 - $130 1TB NVMe SSDs are some of the cheapest devices on the market, and Amazon is offering several models for under $100 during Black Friday. The BIWIN Black Opal NV7400 is on sale for $70 when you click the coupon on its page, while the Acer Predator GM7 and Crucial P310 2280 are just $80 each. All three SSDs provide comparable read/write speeds. There are also officially licensed PS5 SSDs from Seagate and Western Digital, but these do cost more than the options listed above. For PC gamers, we'd recommend the Crucial P510 with read/write speeds of up to 11,000/9,500 MB/s. While it will work with PS5 consoles as well, the specs are pure overkill for that system. Crucial P310 2280 -- $80 ($109) Crucial P510 -- $100 ($130) Acer Predator GM7 (No heatsink) -- $80 with coupon ($101) Biwin Black Opal NV7400 (No heatsink) -- $70 with coupon ($95) WD Black SN850P -- $130 ($159) Seagate 1TB Game Drive for PS5 -- $120 ($135) See at Amazon 2TB SSDs $135 - $190 While an extra terabyte is great for your system, a 2TB SSD is even better. These don't cost much more than the 1TB SSDs, and you can get one like the Crucial P310 2280 for as low as $135. This has read/write speeds of up to 6,000 MB/s and 7,100 MB/s, making it ideal for PS5 consoles. The more expensive options here include the officially licensed Seagate PS5 SSD for $170 (was $215) and the Crucial T710 for $190 (was $320). The Crucial SSD is once again specced beyond what is required for a PS5 console, so PC power users looking to handle demanding programs and move large files will want to consider grabbing this one. Crucial P310 2280 -- $135 ($178) Seagate 2TB Game Drive For PS5 -- $170 ($215) Crucial T710 -- $190 ($320) See at Amazon 4TB SSDs $240 (was $328) A 4TB SSD is pretty big, but the benefit of installing one is that you'll future-proof your PC or PS5. One of the best deals we've seen so far for these chunky SSDs is the PS5-compatible Crucial P310, which will work just fine in a PC as well. It delivers up to 7,100 MB/s read and 6,000 MB/s write speeds, and it's on sale for $240 (was $328). See at Amazon SSD Heatsinks As mentioned above, some of these SSDs will require a heatsink. PS5 owners can get the Sabrent heatsink for just $10 (was $14), and it's designed to seamlessly fit an M.2 drive and replace the native PS5 cover when placed in the expansion bay. Constructed from high-quality CNC'd aluminum, this has been a popular choice because it efficiently disperses heat. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
