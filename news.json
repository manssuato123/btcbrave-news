    "title": "Finally, Bigfoot Has Been Spotted For Real ... In Fortnite",
    "description": "Bigfoot isn't a myth. It's real, and it's really wandering around the forests ... in Fortnite, as a new update added the mythical sasquatch to the battle royale shooter. Thanks to a recent 39.10 update that landed on December 11, players noticed something strange in Fortnite's woods. Apparently, Epic Games introduced Bigfoot to the game's sprawling world, but it isn't easy to find. Bigfoot roams the entire map, meaning it could appear by the Fore Fields, near the Humble Hills, and anywhere in between. It's also immune to damage, so shooting it means nothing. And if you get within 35 meters, it vanishes, leaving you on yet another wild sasquatch hunt before getting blasted to death. BIGFOOT WAS ADDED IN TODAY'S UPDATE 😭He walks around the entire map, is immune to damage, and will disappear if you get too close to him(via @FN_Assist) pic.twitter.com/Mdi5GxeSoU — Shiina (@ShiinaBR) December 11, 2025 Contrary to its name, however, Bigfoot isn't that big. As players found it, it actually appears rather little. The perspective could be off, but based on screenshots circulating on X, Bigfoot looks no bigger than a budding flower. Maybe it should be known as \"Littlefoot,\" then. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Kotaku reported that a 60-second trailer can cost up to $450,000, with the price scaling to $1 million for a three-minute trailer. The ad sales team for The Game Awards can charge that much due in part to the show's massive scale. The Game Awards 2024 drew an audience of 154 million livestreams, which was up from 118 million for The Game Awards 2023. This counts streams on YouTube, Twitch, Steam, TikTok, X, Instagram, Facebook, and international platforms like Bilibili and WeChat in China, among other sources. The viewership number for The Game Awards 2024 was many millions higher than the latest Super Bowl (127.7 million), but the comparison is not apples to apples. Super Bowl ads for Super Bowl LIX this past February reportedly cost as much as $8 million for 30 seconds. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Over on Reddit, the details of the lag became apparent when someone posted the delay between moving the Joy-Con stick and his character reacting in the game. \"There's like a whole second between me flicking the stick and my character moving its head.\" Input delay on Skyrim (Switch 2 Edition) is terrible byu/AZURE-Spirit inNintendoSwitch The discussion evolved into comparing Skyrim's Switch 2 version to Cyberpunk 2077, which runs at 40 frames per second on the same hardware while showing more detailed worlds. Another common complaint is the game's size: Skyrim takes up 53GB of the Switch 2's limited internal storage, even though it uses only 25GB on PC.

    "description": "Maybe as a holiday treat, Nintendo has added a new GameCube title for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers out of the blue. Wario World is now playable for the service on Switch 2. Originally released in 2003, Wario World is a 3D platformer that sees the antihero looking for payback after his treasure is stolen and his castle destroyed. Coincidentally, Treasure is the developer behind the GameCube title. The studio is known for Gunstar Heroes, Sin and Punishment, and Ikaruga. Wario World brings the GameCube library up to seven titles on Switch 2 for the Expansion Pack tier. What's intriguing about Wario World is that Nintendo has teased GameCube titles that still aren't out on the service, such as Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance and Pokemon Colosseum. Meanwhile, Wario World hadn't previously been mentioned. Luigi's Mansion arrived on the subscription service right before Halloween and was the last addition. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Currently a timed exclusive through the Microsoft Store, the Fallout Pip-Boy Xbox controller is now available to order for $83 (was $99). If you want to add some flair, you can also customize the controller through the Xbox Design Labs, which lets you choose button styles, upgrade to metallic triggers and D-pads, rubberize the side and back grips, and add an engraving. Xbox Wireless Controller – Fallout Pip-Boy $83 (was $99) Inspired by Vault-Tec's wearable computer, this controller features a black top case, the outer casing of a Pip-Boy, and a bright green Vault Boy icon in the center. The D-pad sports a healthy radioactive glow, and several other design elements replicate the Valued-Added Targeting System from Fallout. Beyond that, this is a standard Xbox wireless controller. It's still the same design that was introduced five years ago, with textured triggers, tactile face buttons, and a very clicky D-pad. These controllers can be powered by AA batteries or a rechargeable battery pack sold separately; they're equipped with an audio jack for wired headphones, and their ergonomic design still makes them very comfortable to use for long stretches. The other great thing about the Xbox controller is that it can be used on multiple platforms, including PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and mobile devices via Bluetooth. See at Microsoft Store Xbox gamers looking for a premium option can grab the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller with a Fallout finish. Priced at $164.58 (was $185), this premium edition of the controller offers adjustable-tension thumbsticks, shorter hair-trigger locks, rubberized grips, and interchangeable components.

Regardless, Microsoft has announced that the Call of Duty franchise led the charge on Xbox Game Pass in 2025 in two key categories. On social media, the official account for Xbox Game Pass noted that Call of Duty ranked first for total players and hours in 2025. Specific figures beyond that weren't included in the announcement. In addition to #1 in November, @CallofDuty closed out 2025 as the #1 franchise on Xbox Game Pass for total players and hours all year 🫡Here’s to @CallofDuty &amp; its worldwide community. Season 1 of #BlackOps7 + Call of Duty: Warzone is just getting warmed up. — Xbox Game Pass (@XboxGamePass) December 10, 2025 The timing is interesting because Activision released a statement of its own earlier this week which acknowledged that Black Ops 7 fell short of the mark the publisher set for itself.
