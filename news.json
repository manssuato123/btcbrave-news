Both officially licensed machines carry $150 retail prices, though Class of '81 has routinely sold for closer to $170 since Amazon restocked it in July. Class of '81 is a combo Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga machine that consistently outsells the Pac-Man edition on Amazon. If Amazon sells out, Walmart has the Class of '81 Countercade for the same price right now. Both of these compact cabinets include three preloaded Namco arcade classics, 7-inch, vertically oriented displays, and full-size arcade controls. It's worth noting that both models released ahead of the 2024 holiday season and sold out at full price. Given the budget-friendly prices, Arcade1Up Countercades are popular holiday gifts.

    "description": "Lego Star Wars Imperial Star Destroyer (1,555 pieces) $120 (was $160) See at Amazon Amazon has added one of the most popular Lego Star Wars ships available today to its Black Friday Lego sale. The 1,555-piece Imperial Star Destroyer is on sale for $120 (was $160) while supplies last. This Star Destroyer launched last August as part of the Lego Star Wars 25th Anniversary collection. It comes with seven minifigures, including a 25th Anniversary minifigure of Cal Kestis from Respawn's Star Wars Jedi series. The Imperial Star Destroyer is based on the ship from the opening chase scene of Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope. Once fully constructed, the Star Destroyer measures 18 x 11.5 x 6 inches. It's rather fitting that Amazon added the Star Destroye to its Black Friday sale, because Star Wars fans can also get the Lego version of the ship Darth Vader and his crew were chasing: Princess Leia's Tantive IV. The 654-piece Tantive IV display model is 50% off at Amazon and Walmart. You could pair both of these ships with Lego's Boarding the Tantive IV diorama, which is on sale for $38.49 (was $55) and depicts what happens after the Star Destroyer catches the Tantive IV. It's also worth noting Lego's 630-piece midi-scale model of Darth Vader's Executor Super Star Destroyer from Return of the Jedi is on sale for $40 (was $70) at Walmart. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
