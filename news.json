    "description": "Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle $449 (was $500) See at Amazon See at Walmart Amazon has restocked the Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle and is once again matching Walmart's deal. This promotion could end at any time, but as of December 3 at 12 PM PT, the Switch 2 with Mario Kart World is available for $449 (was $500) at Amazon and Walmart. Best Buy has increased the price back to $500, and Target sold out on Cyber Monday. Discounts on Nintendo consoles are rare in general, but it's genuinely shocking to see a deal on the Switch 2 less than six months after launch. The $51 discount will show up after you add the bundle to your cart at Walmart. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle $449 (was $500) The Mario Kart World console bundle is valued at $530, so you're essentially getting a copy of the Switch 2 exclusive for free. The bundle includes a voucher that can be redeemed on the Switch 2 eShop for the digital edition of Mario Kart World. Here's what's included inside the box: Switch 2 with 7.9-inch LCD display Joy-Con 2: Left and Right Joy-Con 2 Straps Joy-Con 2 Grip Dock for TV Mode Ultra High-Speed HDMI Cable USB-C Cable 60W AC adapter Voucher for Mario Kart World The Mario Kart bundle is selling for the same price as the Switch 2 console on its own. Nintendo previously stated the Mario Kart bundle would only be available until Fall 2025, so Amazon and Walmart might be clearing out their remaining units before the bundle disappears for good. See at Amazon See at Walmart One of the first accessories every new Switch 2 owner should buy is a carrying case. There are still a few officially licensed Nintendo Switch 2 travel cases on sale for Cyber Monday prices. For a case that's large enough for the console and dock, check out the RDS Industries Game Traveler Deluxe System Case for $25 (was $30). If you'd prefer a sleeker travel case, the PowerA Slim Case is on sale for $15 (was $20) at Amazon. The Metroid Prime 4: Beyond version of the Slim Case is discounted to $15 (was $20), too.

Speaking to Ars Technica, Gilbert said this game had a vision of being a \"large, open-world-type RPG\" in the vein of The Legend of Zelda. Gilbert worked alongside two other people--an artist and a designer--for about a year on the project before Gilbert realized it was not going to happen. \"I just [didn't] have the money or the time to build a big open-world game like that,\" he said. \"You know, it's either a passion project you spent 10 years on, or you just need a bunch of money to be able to hire people and resources.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The restock arrives just one week after Blaze Entertainment launched the new Taito edition in the US. Officially licensed by Capcom, the Street Fighter and Mega Man countertop cabinets launched last November and then disappeared from Amazon in early 2025.

The Taito edition is temporarily out of stock at Amazon. The two Evercade Alpha Capcom editions have six preloaded games each, while the Taito edition has 10 games. These cartridge-based countertop arcade machines support Evercade's expansive catalog of retro game collections. Over a dozen additional digital games can be unlocked in the Evercade OS Secret menu.

    "description": "Getting 100% completion in a Metroid game--and metroidvania titles in general--is a satisfying achievement that's part of the genre's appeal. However, in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, there is unfortunately a way to pigeonhole yourself where collecting everything needed isn't possible. Now, the game will warn you about a point of no return, but it's still easy to make a regrettable decision. That's why GameSpot's reviewer for the first-person adventure, Steve Watts, advises players to make a copy of their main save in another save slot before entering the endgame. Watts detailed the \"confusing choice\" that Nintendo and developer Retro Studios made in his Metroid Prime 4 review. \"When I was ready to proceed to the endgame, I got the usual warnings about a point of no return, but I had figured I could always load an older save to go back and do more exploring to pick up power-ups that I missed,\" Watts wrote. \"But the auto-save now has me locked into the final area with no such apparent option, and my regular save slot--the one that activates when Samus steps into a save station--has been overwritten with a Mission Complete, so loading it prompts me to start a new game.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

In addition, I would like to think about things beyond the games so that we can further expand the potential of the Monster Hunter IPs.'\" There was a live-action Monster Hunter movie in 2020 from director Paul W. S. Anderson and actress Milla Jovovich, the husband-and-wife team behind the first six Resident Evil films.

    "description": "Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has enjoyed an exceptional year, becoming the most-nominated game in the history of The Game Awards. Its cast--Ben Starr, Charlie Cox, and Jennifer English among them--earned major recognition in the show's performance categories, helping cement the game as one of the year's standout achievements. But even while celebrating this success, the cast has been discussing ways the awards could grow, especially when it comes to recognizing the full range of performance work that brings modern games to life. In an interview with Video Games Chronicle, cast members English, Shayla Nyx, Devora Wilde, and Aliona Baranova shared their hope that The Game Awards will eventually expand its performance categories. They explained that, while the nominations are an honor, the current categories overlook many essential performers. \"If I may, can I put my petition forward for why we need to have a motion capture category?\" Baranova said. \"It's been decades of actors going in, doing the mocap, and then someone else's voice is popped on top, and those mocap performers just disappear. I forgot that. Nobody knows about them.” Baranova, who worked as a motion capture director on Baldur's Gate 3, noted that this issue has persisted for years. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
