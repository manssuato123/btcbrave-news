    "title": "Fortnite Made Quentin Tarantino's Long-Awaited Unfinished Chapter A Reality",
    "description": "Quentin Tarantino's fourth film, Kill Bill, was famously so long that it was split into two separate movies: Kill Bill Volume 1 and its sequel, Volume 2, released about half a year apart back in the early aughts. Soon, it'll celebrate a re-release, Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair, which stitches the movies back together and adds new scenes, too. But even a movie of its length has scenes left on the cutting room floor. Using Epic's Unreal Engine, Tarantino is closing a chapter of his career that's been more than 20 years in the making. Totally separate from the new scenes found within The Whole Bloody Affair, The Lost Chapter: Yuki's Revenge is a roughly 10-minute scene built in Unreal Engine that brings together the Kill Bill series and, unexpectedly--or perhaps not--Fortnite. I recently attended the premiere of Yuki's Revenge at the packed Vista Theater in Los Angeles, alongside Tarantino and \"The Bride\" herself, Uma Thurman, who were on hand to debut this long-lost scene now that it's found its surprising home. The scene, Tarantino explained after the showing, was always considered by him to have happened in the canon of the Kill Bill story. \"The audience just didn't see it,\" he explained, as it wasn't feasible at that time for the cast and crew to film what is essentially another bloody fight scene in a movie already full of them. Its absence was known to film buffs and fans of the director going back years, with many wishing it had made it into the movie originally. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Fortnite's biggest day of the year started off with a massive live event that wrapped up Chapter 6, and if all goes well, Chapter 7 will begin very soon. In the meantime, though, Fortnite's servers are offline for maintenance and to deploy the Chapter 7 update. There's no bug here--Fortnite is offline on purpose. But it shouldn't be down for long. When will Fortnite Chapter 7 start? In the past, the start of a new chapter came with longer periods of downtime--like a day or more--but these days Epic tends to treat new season and new chapter updates the same as it would a regular mid-month patch. That means you can expect Fortnite to be offline for between 4 and 7 hours, with Chapter 7 likely launching in the evening on Saturday, November 29, likely around 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET--primetime, in other words. We guarantee nothing, however, as these launches don't always go smoothly. Just a month ago, when the Simpsons season began, all seemed well when Fortnite returned from maintenance--but after an hour, the servers crashed and the game went back offline for a while. And there was another update earlier this year that ended up taking Fortnite offline for an entire additional day. But such incidents are rare, and most updates go off without major hitches.

The 1,555-piece Imperial Star Destroyer is on sale for $120 (was $160) while supplies last. This Star Destroyer launched last August as part of the Lego Star Wars 25th Anniversary collection. It comes with seven minifigures, including a 25th Anniversary minifigure of Cal Kestis from Respawn's Star Wars Jedi series. The Imperial Star Destroyer is based on the ship from the opening chase scene of Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope. Once fully constructed, the Star Destroyer measures 18 x 11.5 x 6 inches. It's rather fitting that Amazon added the Star Destroye to its Black Friday sale, because Star Wars fans can also get the Lego version of the ship Darth Vader and his crew were chasing: Princess Leia's Tantive IV. The 654-piece Tantive IV display model is 50% off at Amazon and Walmart. You could pair both of these ships with Lego's Boarding the Tantive IV diorama, which is on sale for $38.49 (was $55) and depicts what happens after the Star Destroyer catches the Tantive IV. It's also worth noting Lego's 630-piece midi-scale model of Darth Vader's Executor Super Star Destroyer from Return of the Jedi is on sale for $40 (was $70) at Walmart. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
