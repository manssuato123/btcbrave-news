    "description": "In February 2023, Wizards of the Coast closed an internal game development studio, and with it cancelled multiple unannounced titles, one of them being Whimpact!, a \"Pokemon meets Fall Guys\" online multiplayer game. Rather than let it die, Leah Hoyer, who was at the time VP of creative for WotC, opened her own studio called Level Headed Games, acquired the rights to Whimpact!, and continued development--and it's set to release in early access soon. Whimpact! drops players into the world of Whims, cute little creatures that pass along magical powers to those who collect and care for them. The more they're cared for, the stronger those powers will be. Up to eight players will be able to join together in co-op arena-style gameplay as they collect Whims, gather mystical energy called Starcane, and navigate obstacles while fighting hordes of robotic invaders trying to steal the energy for themselves. Gallery There are seven different types of Whims to collect, each with six different color variants. The power each Whim gives the player will depend on its color, with powers including increased speed, increased strength, high jumping ability, longer jumping ability, and more. Players will be able to mix and match powers, including swapping Whims on the fly, during a match as well. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "A Balatro-Like Slots Machine Game Surprise-Launched On Xbox Game Pass",
    "description": "For the first time, CloverPit is available on console after surprise-releasing yesterday on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox Game Pass (Ultimate and Premium tiers). The slot machine roguelike takes inspiration from Balatro and Buckshot Roulette, even featuring Jimbo from the former in the new Xbox launch trailer seen below. Players are tasked with paying off their gambling debt from inside a disgusting cell, and if they can't, they take a terrible tumble. CloverPit originally came out on Steam on September 26. It was one of the games that actually delayed its release to avoid Hollow Knight: Silksong on September 4. CloverPit planned to launch September 3 initially. That change of course seems to have played out favorably for the roguelike, as publisher Future Friends Games and developer Panik Arcade have stated CloverPit has sold over 1 million copies on Steam so far. Panik Arcade teased new DLC for CloverPit in the Xbox launch trailer as well. On X, the developer notes that the add-on will be named Unholy Fusion and will release on PC and Xbox. However, it's unknown at this time if it will be free or paid DLC. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The Xbox Partner Preview showed off a bunch of cool and interesting projects coming to Xbox consoles and PC in the future, including Armatus, The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu, and Raji: Kaliyuga. However, the event itself bucked an annoying trend that other trailer showcases continue to follow, as each trailer that aired during the event showed the logos for every console the game will launch on, not just Xbox. Traditionally, when a game makes an appearance during one of these events, the final shot confirms the game for the host company's consoles--PlayStation consoles for Sony, the Switch or Switch 2 for Nintendo, and so on. However, in yesterday's event the PS5 and Nintendo Switch 2 logos appeared multiple times throughout the showcase. The final shot from the Armatus trailer that aired during the Xbox Partner Preview.Of the 16 titles shown during the Xbox Partner Preview, 13 of them included either a PlayStation or Nintendo Switch logo in their ending graphic. The three exceptions were Echo Generation 2, Roadside Research, and Cloverpit, but all three of them are, as of this writing, only coming to Xbox consoles. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Those titular fruits are the keys to success, but not only are some rarer than others, but vendors constantly change their wares, so we’re here to explain everything you need to know about the Blox Fruits stock as well as restock times. Table of Contents [hide]What is the Blox Fruits Stock System? What is the Blox Fruits Stock System? The most important part of Blox Fruit is, unsurprisingly, those titular Blox Fruits. If you want to expand your collection, you will need to amass some money through regular gameplay and then head to a vendor to buy Blox Fruit. Sadly, not all of the Blox Fruit are available at once, and their appearance is dictated by their rarity. So, you’re much more likely to see common Blox Fruit than you are rare ones. Anyone wanting to expand their abilities or collect all of the Blox Fruit will need to routinely visit the in-game vendors with the hopes of eventually finding and purchasing every Blox Fruit in the game. Regular vendors have at least three Blox Fruit, while the Advanced Fruit Dealer on Mirage Island holds five. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The era of console wars seems to be nearing its end, but one of its key players, Peter Moore, who led the charge during the launch of the Xbox 360, is sharing his memories of his time on the gaming frontlines. When it came to pitting the Xbox 360 against the PlayStation 3, Moore says 10 million was the magic number--\"You've got this flywheel effect ... of [if] your mate in the school yard's got one, you better get one.\" Speaking to Eurogamer, Moore explained that getting the Xbox 360 into the market ahead of the PS3 was key to its strong performance, saying that the first 10 million sales were vital. \"I think it was really important to get it out first,\" Moore said. \"Get going, get momentum, and aim for that 10 million installed base that I felt that would give us an amazing advantage over whatever Sony could do to catch up.\" He explained that having the 10 million install base creates a network effect where a sense of social pressure could drive sales--\"All of a sudden you're out of place and you're on the outside if you're not coming to school, or going to class in college the next day, or even coming to work, and saying what a night we had playing Halo, or whatever game it happened to be.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The company says that its Q2 net bookings exceeded expectations and its deal with Tencent to invest $1.2 billion in Vantage Studios--a new subsidiary focused on its three main franchises--is expected to close within a few days. Ubisoft says that its Q2 net bookings were up 39% year-on-year, driven by stronger-than-expected performance across its games catalogue and TV projects. The company had initially predicted that it would reach $520 million for its quarterly books, but this figure increased to $566.7 million. \"Our portfolio showed contrasting dynamics this quarter, with softer trends for Rainbow Six Siege, reflecting a phase of evolution for the game in an intense FPS environment, offset by strong performances across the rest of the catalog. The Assassin’s Creed franchise exceeded our expectations, confirming its positive momentum and ability to engage players over time. The Division 2 also continued to perform strongly, benefiting from the momentum of the Battle for Brooklyn DLC,\" Ubisoft Yves Guillemot said in a press release. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
