    "description": "Samurai Champloo: The Complete Series Limited Edition $54 (was $90) See at Amazon Cowboy Bebop: The Complete Series (Blu-ray) $27 (was $60) See at Amazon Cowboy Bebop: The Complete Series Steelbook Edition (Blu-ray) $66.65 | Walmart Exclusive See at Walmart Samurai Champloo: The Complete Series has received a limited-time discount at Amazon that drops the price to only $54 (was $90). Released last fall, this limited-edition box set has only been discounted to this low of a price once before--and that was six months ago. Samurai Champloo's production was led by legendary anime director Shinichiro Watanabe, who is best known for directing Cowboy Bebop. If you don't yet own Cowboy Bebop on Blu-ray, you have a few great options right now, including the standard Blu-ray for only $26 (was $60) and the Walmart-exclusive Steelbook Edition for $66.65. Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo are widely considered two of the best anime of all time. Samurai Champloo isn't the only Watanabe series on sale for its best price yet on Blu-ray. Space Dandy: The Complete Series is discounted to only $42 (was $70) at Amazon. We've rounded up more great Cyber Week anime deals at the bottom of this story, including Akira on 4K Blu-ray for only $12 and the 4K Steelbook Edition for $19. See all anime deals at Amazon Samurai Champloo: The Complete Series Limited Edition $54 (was $90) Samurai Champloo: The Complete Series Limited Edition is a 3-disc set featuring all 26 episodes that aired on Adult Swim in 2004-2005. The episodes are upscaled to 1080p and are presented in their original 16:9 aspect ratio. The set comes with a stylish display case, six art cards, and the three discs even have concept art printed on the labels. Special features include promotional videos, trailers, an image gallery, concept art, and textless opening/closing credit sequences. Like Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo blends striking visuals, meticulously animated fight scenes, and contemporary music to create an anime that is oozing with style. For Samurai Champloo, Watanabe opted for the jazzy beats and street fashion aesthetics of underground hip-hop. The show is set in alternate Edo-era Japan and follows the young waitress Fuu and her two unlikely companions--the outlaw Mugen and the ronin Ji--on an adventure to find a mysterious samurai who smells of sunflowers. Samurai Champloo often ranks high on lists of the best anime--though admittedly not quite as high as Bebop. Nevertheless, it's well worth picking up while it's on sale. See at Amazon Cowboy Bebop: The Complete Series (Blu-ray) $27 (was $60) Widely considered one of, if not, the best anime series of all time, Cowboy Bebop is a sci-fi western about bounty hunters Spike and Jet, who eke out a living chasing down targets across the solar system. Throughout the series, their crew expands to include the femme fatale Faye Valentine, young hacker Ed, and a super-genius Welsh Corgi named Ein. As the ragtag group completes various jobs on behalf of shadowy clients, they eventually find themselves entangled in a multi-planetary conspiracy. If you're looking to grab the series on Blu-ray, you have two budget-friendly options at major retailers. The cheapest version is the 4-disc Complete Series that launched in 2014. You can get this one for only $27, which is a steal considering the quality of Cowboy Bebop. The standard edition includes the following special features: Memo From Bebop: The Dub Sessions Remembered Dinner Aboard the Bebop Ein's Summer Vacation \"Tank!\" Music Clips Textless Opening and Ending Songs The 25th Anniversary Special Edition is available for $35 and includes a bonus disc with the content listed above as well as the following new features: 25th Anniversary Retrospective 6 Audio Commentary Sessions 20th Anniversary Interview with Koichi Yamadera (voice of Spike Spiegel) Interview with Wendee Lee Interview with Cartoon Network producer Sean Akins Aside from the extra bonuses and different packaging, these Blu-ray sets are otherwise identical. All Blu-ray editions of Cowboy Bebop collect all 26 episodes, remastered in high definition while retaining their original 4:3 aspect ratio, and the option watch with English or Japanese audio. If you want to truly complete your Cowboy Bebop collection, Cowboy Bebop: The Movie is available for $20 at Amazon. This Blu-ray edition is a region-free import. See at Amazon Cowboy Bebop: The Complete Series Steelbook Edition (Blu-ray) $66.65 | Walmart Exclusive Big Cowboy Bebop fans may want to pick up the wonderfully designed Limited Edition Steelbook. Exclusive to Walmart and often sold out, Cowboy Bebop's Steelbook Edition is available once again as of December 4 for $66.65. See at Walmart Anime Blu-ray Deals at Amazon (December 2025) Other notable anime deals at Amazon include all four seasons of Attack on Titan with exclusive steelbook cases, multiple Rebuild of Evangelion Blu-rays and DVDs, Berserk's 2016 series for $31.49, and Ninja Scroll for only $10.49.

With that in mind, you may want to pick up The Killer: Deluxe Limited Edition for $50 (was $65) before it's gone. The Killer just landed on 4K Blu-ray this week (December 2). While you're checking out these deals, you should also consider preordering the upcoming 4K Blu-ray editions of Bullet in the Head and Once a Thief; both films launch January 26, 2026 and are available to preorder for $34 (was $40) each.

    "description": "Pokemon Pokopia (Switch 2) $70 | Releases March 5, 2026 See at Amazon See at Walmart See at Best Buy See at Nintendo Store A new Pokemon game is out next year for Switch 2, and it looks like a wild spin-off from your typical \"gotta-catch-'em-all\" experience. Pokemon Pokopia is an open-world game where players build a utopia for wild pocket monsters. The game launches on March 5, 2026. and preoders are available now for $70 at Amazon, Walmart, and several other retailers. Players who preorder the game will also receive an in-game Ditto rug for their Pokopia world. Pokemon Pokopia (Switch 2) $70 | Releases March 5, 2026 First revealed in September 2025, Pokemon Pokopia is set in a world where humanity has vanished and looks inspired by games like Minecraft, Animal Crossing, and Dragon Quest Builders. One peculiar Ditto returns to find the land withered, and its only remaining resident is a Tangrowth, known simply as Professor Tangrwoth. Using its transformation powers to pass itself off as a human, the Ditto works to restore the land and inspire other Pokemon to return. Players won't just be limited to one island, as the Ditto can transform into a Lapras or Dragonite to reach new locations. Crafting also plays a big role in Pokemon Pokopia, as collected materials can be fashioned into tools and infrastructure to improve buildings and complete quests. See at Amazon See at Walmart See at Best Buy Pokemon Pokopia will be the first Nintendo-published game for Switch 2 to be released as a Game Key Card. This means the physical cartridge will serve as an authentication device, and you'll still need to download the full game to your console. It is worth noting that Game Key Cards are not tied to your console, so you can resell them in the future if you choose to. The game will take up roughly 10GBs of space--so if you're planning to buy the game, you'll want to consider picking up a microSD Express card to increase your storage capacity. Luckily, Amazon currently has a great deal on the Samsung P9 512GB card. Normally $100, this is on sale for $75 while stocks last. Amazon has also restocked the Switch 2 Mario Kart bundle and is matching Walmart's deal price of $449 (was $500), in case you're looking to get a Switch 2 for the festive season. For more Switch 2 deals, you can also check out our buying guide for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond to see the best prices on the highly anticipated game, related merchandise, and Amiibo figures.

At the PC Games Show, 1047 Games announced that Splitgate 2 will return as Splitgate: Arena Reloaded on December 17, with massive gameplay and progression changes that aim to bring the shooter closer to its roots. According to 1047 Games design director Josh Watson, the studio has been rebuilding the game \"from the ground up,\" incorporating and refining the best elements from both Splitgate games while \"removing what didn't work.\" In a video announcement, Watson specifically cited Unreal Tournament, Quake, and Halo as the main inspirations for Splitgate. To that end, the rebooted Splitgate will lack the Factions and Abilities introduced in Splitgate 2 for a more \"classic arena combat\" experience. Arena Reloaded also contains retooled progression and ranked systems, along with reduced in-game store prices; Splitgate 2's microtransactions were a major pain point with players when the game first launched.

Samus Aran picks up a few new tricks in this sequel, including her new bike, the Vi-O-La. But if you want to hear some optional ambient music while Samus cruises the deserts of planet Viewros, it's going to cost you $30 or the price of a Samus Aran Amiibo. Players have discovered that plugging in the Samus Amiibo enables Vi-O-La Radio, which enables players to choose the music that accompanies Samus's extended journey across the Sol Valley desert on the Vi-O-La. There is already some ambient music and noise to go with those scenes, this just allows players to choose music tracks from other areas to listen to. Finishing the game will also unlock two additional tracks for Vi-O-La Radio. The regular ambient music of Sol Valley doesn't make it a bad experience, and it seems to be evoking something thematically about the planet's history. The music may not be necessary, but some fans may resent having to pay for an option that could have just as easily been included in the base game. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "You'd be forgiven for losing track of how many survival games have come out in the last decade or so, and though I personally enjoy many of them myself, it's exciting to see a new one come along and dramatically overhaul what a survival game looks like, mechanically speaking. In a crowded genre, Hello Sunshine stands out. Yes, it's a survival game with many of the mechanics you'd expect, but it doesn't look quite like any others, thanks to its one (literally) huge twist. That twist is the gigantic robot companion you have by your side. The building-sized automaton walks almost ceaselessly toward a destination, and it's your mission to use its shadow to stay safe from the scorching sun, while strategically dashing into landmarks to quickly loot supplies, all while you dodge other, smaller bots along the way. Hello Sunshine is set in a post-apocalyptic world full of antagonistic robots, and if you're to survive, you'll need to scavenge food, water, and materials to build tools and weapons--all while avoiding the unforgiving rays of the sun. But rather than settle down and build a base for yourself and your robo-pal, you're almost always on the move. It's a much more nomadic experience than, say, Valheim or Minecraft.

    "title": "Just Cause Creator Revs Up With New Action Game Samson",
    "description": "In 2020, Just Cause creator and Avalanche Studios founder Christofer Sundberg started a new company, Liquid Swords, alongside other industry veterans. Now, the team at Liquid Swords has shared the first trailer for its debut action title, Samson: A Tyndalston Story. It may remind some fans of Grand Theft Auto, but there are differences that make it a lot harder to earn money in this game. Tyndalston is the name of the city, and players will step into the role of Samson McCray, an aging criminal who is facing a crushing debt. Players can steal the money they need, but this isn't like other open-world crime games where you can keep going non-stop. Samson has physical limits as to what he can pull off in a day, which are measured by action points. Use too many on a single job and you won't be able to do much else. As time passes in this world, your debt increases. For every crime you commit, the city remembers and your reputation grows. According to Liquid Swords, \"There are no do-overs. You move forward because standing still makes everything worse.\" This is a story about debt, consequences, and survival. Samson will have to deal with all three on a daily basis.
