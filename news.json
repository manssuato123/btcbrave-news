    "title": "Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack Restocked At Amazon For $25",
    "description": "Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack $25.31 (was $30) See at Amazon See at Walmart Another Metroid Amiibo launches this week with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. The third and final Metroid Prime 4 Amiibo, Sylux, is available to order for $30 at Amazon and other major retailers. Like other Amiibo released during the Switch 2 era, all three Metroid Prime 4 Amiibo are more expensive than collectors were used to before 2025. That's why it's refreshing to see Amazon restock the Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack for $25.31 (was $30). The Dread Amiibo set isn't difficult to find for around MSRP, but it's rare to see it sold by a major retailer. Usually you need to buy it from a third-party seller, but this restock is sold and shipped by Amazon. Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack $25.31 (was $30) The Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack is cool for multiple reasons. For Samus fans, it's one of the few collectibles featuring the bounty hunter's regenerating Varia Suit. The blue-tinged sections on the suit are organic matter from the Fusion Suit. This directly ties back to the events of Metroid Fusion. In the 2002 Game Boy Advance game, Samus was infected by the X parasite. She received the Metroid vaccine, but when Dread starts, her Varia Suit is still in the process of regenerating to its normal form. The Metroid Dread Samus Amiibo is cool, but the E.M.M.I. Amiibo might be cooler. One of the most unsettling enemies in franchise history, the Extraplanetary Multiform Mobile Identifier--better known as EMMI--is robot nightmare fuel. Like Samus, the EMMI Amiibo's pose matches official key art. If Amazon sells out, you can buy the Metroid Dread 2-Pack from a third-party seller on Walmart Marketplace for roughly the same price. See at Amazon See at Walmart Where to Buy Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Amiibo Metroid Prime 4: Beyond for Nintendo Switch 2 $70 | Releases December 4 Preorder at Best Buy Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Walmart Preorder at GameStop Preorder at Target Metroid Prime 4: Beyond for Nintendo Switch $60 | Releases December 4 Preorder at Best Buy Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Walmart Preorder at Target Preorder at GameStop If you haven't picked up the Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Amiibo, all three are in stock at Amazon.

The official Metroid Prime 4 edition of the PowerA Slim Case for Switch 2 is up for grabs for only $15 (was $20), and a Metroid Prime Trilogy Crossbody Bag is down to $20 (was $25).

    "description": "The dream of Skyblivion goes back over a decade as a team of fans came together to use The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's engine to fully recreate and re-imagine Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion as a modern RPG. At the beginning of 2023, the team set a 2025 premiere for Skyblivion. However, that's no longer the plan and Skyblivion has been pushed to next year. The good news is that the latest dev video shows off how much has been finished and what remains to be done. Skyblivion lead Rebelzize narrates the video as he offers a guide to where things stand. According to Rebelzize, most of the work has already been done and over 70 volunteer contributors are still hard at work trying to get the ambitious mod across the finish line. When this project was started, The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion was far out of date. Earlier this year, Bethesda released Oblivion Remastered, which could have taken the wind out of this team's project. Instead, Rebelzize and others praised the remaster as a \"win-win\" for the community. In recognition for their work, Bethesda gave copies of Oblivion Remastered to the entire Skyblivion mod team.

The Samsung P9 512GB microSD Express Card for Nintendo Switch 2 is on sale for $75 (was $100). This is marked as a limited-time deal, but it's unclear when the price will climb back to $100. But if you're looking for a deal on a 1TB Express, you're in luck: The Silicon Power 1TB microSD Express is available for $154 (was $220) when you click the coupon box on Amazon's store page. The 512GB edition is also 30% off, but Amazon's stock is running low. These are the lowest prices we've seen at Amazon for 512GB and 1TB Express Cards.

Best Buy has increased the price back to $500, and Target sold out on Cyber Monday.

The $51 discount will show up after you add the bundle to your cart at Walmart. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle $449 (was $500) The Mario Kart World console bundle is valued at $530, so you're essentially getting a copy of the Switch 2 exclusive for free.

The restock arrives just one week after Blaze Entertainment launched the new Taito edition in the US. Officially licensed by Capcom, the Street Fighter and Mega Man countertop cabinets launched last November and then disappeared from Amazon in early 2025. All three Alpha Bartop Arcades retail for $280 and are shipped/sold by Solutions 2 Go, which is now the official distributor for the Alpha in the US. The Taito edition is temporarily out of stock at Amazon. The two Evercade Alpha Capcom editions have six preloaded games each, while the Taito edition has 10 games. These cartridge-based countertop arcade machines support Evercade's expansive catalog of retro game collections. Over a dozen additional digital games can be unlocked in the Evercade OS Secret menu. Heads up: Amazon has limited-time deals on over a dozen Evercade cartridges, but these deals end December 4 at 12 AM PT. Amazon's deals on the Super Pocket retro handhelds end tonight, too.
