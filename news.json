    "description": "Digimon The Movies 4-6 Collection (Blu-ray) $20 (was $30) | Releases December 30 Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Crunchyroll Digimon The Movies 1-3 Collection (Blu-ray) $24 (was $30) See at Crunchyroll Check stock at Amazon Check stock at Walmart Digimon fans don't have to wait much longer to watch the uncut versions of three early 2000s movies in English for the first time. Discotek Media's Digimon The Movies 4-6 Collection releases December 30. The preorder price has dropped for the second time at Amazon and Crunchyroll; the $30 Blu-ray collection is now available to preorder for only $20. The 4-6 Collection is a follow-up to Discotek Media's popular Digimon The Movies 1-3 Collection, which released last December. The first collection is currently out of stock everywhere, so if you're interested in watching the new collection at launch, it'd be wise to preorder. Digimon The Movies 4-6 Collection (Blu-ray) $20 (was $30) | Releases December 30 Digimon: The Movies 4-6 Collection includes the following movies with both English dubs and the original Japanese audio with subtitles: Revenge of the Diaboromon (2001) Battle of Adventurers (2001) Runaway Locomon (2002) Though referred to as \"movies,\" these aren't feature-length films. Revenge of the Diaboromon is 29 minutes and is set during the Digimon Adventure 02 timeline. Battle of Adventurers released the same year and has a 50-minute runtime. It was the first movie in the Digimon Tamers timeline, the third Digimon series, and revolves around a virus that causes Digimon to enter the Real World. Runaway Locomon, a 30-minute short film, released in 2002 and takes place after the Digimon Tamers season finale. The collection has a total runtime of 2 hours and 9 minutes. The runtime is 10 minutes longer than the originals because these are uncut versions that were restored with English dubs by Discotek. The runtimes listed above correspond with the original releases, not the uncut versions. Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Crunchyroll Digimon The Movies 1-3 Collection (Blu-ray) $24 (was $30) Digimon: The Movies 1-3 Collection released on Blu-ray last December and was on sale for only $18 (was $30) for Black Friday. That deal caused it to sell out at all retailers. Crunchyroll is letting customers place orders for $24, but the Blu-ray is currently on backorder with an undetermined shipping date. Digimon Adventure (1999) Our War Game (2000) Hurricane Touchdown (2000) Parts of these three movies were spliced together to create Digimon: The Movie (2000), the first feature-length theatrical release for the franchise. Discotek restored the uncut versions of all three short films with a new English dub. The runtime for the collection is 2 hours and 9 minutes, more than 40 minutes longer than the 88-minute feature film. The Blu-ray collection also comes with Digimon: The Movie's original dubbed version, so fans can watch the story as they did in theaters as kids, too.

See at Amazon Digimon TV Series on Blu-ray Digimon Adventure: Season 1 &amp; Digimon Adventure 02: Season 2Discotek Media has steadily brought classic Digimon anime to Blu-ray over the past few years. Digimon Adventure and Digimon Adventure 02 are both available on Blu-ray with versions with English dubs and the original Japanese with subtitles. Unlike the movie collections, though, there are separate English and Japanese editions. At the moment, all four are in stock at Amazon, though only Digimon Adventure 02 in Japanese is discounted below MSRP. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is having a remarkable second run this month after winning Game of the Year at The Game Awards. It was already one of the top hits of the year, but that added exposure has pushed Expedition 33 even higher than before. According to Alinea Analytics, sales of Expedition 33 jumped 21% on PlayStation 5 and 76% on Steam. The bump was a considerably smaller 3% on Xbox, likely because Expedition 33 is on Game Pass. Regardless, the combined sales across PC and consoles post-The Game Awards is estimated to be over 200,000 additional copies. Sandfall deftly timed new DLC for Expedition 33 to drop almost as soon as it won its final award at The Game Awards. That likely helped fuel the rush of new and returning players that pushed it to 56,993 concurrent players over the weekend, via SteamDB. That's the game's highest count since June.

    "title": "Target's Best Exclusive Lego Sets Get Rare Holiday Discounts",
    "description": "Target-Exclusive Lego Set Deals 14 exclusives and dozens more Lego sets are on sale this week. See all deals at Target Target has kicked off a last-minute holiday sale on Lego sets that's arguably better than the promotion it ran during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The discounts aren't as large as last month's sale, but more products are included, and most importantly, a greater quantity of exclusives are up for grabs. Target has more exclusive Lego sets than any other major retailer, including a bunch of models designed for adults. And by \"exclusive,\" we mean you can only buy them at Target or the Lego Store--though typically you'll pay full price directly from Lego. We've rounded up all of the Target-exclusive Lego sets on sale this week, including two Star Wars models, two Spider-Man sets, a very cool Mario Kart racing set, and unique builds themed around major movie franchises like Gremlins, Willy Wonka, and Wicked. Target-Exclusive Lego Set Deals (December 2025) Lego Ideas: Gremlins Gizmo (1,125 pieces) -- $88 ($110) Lego Ideas: Magic of Disney (1,103 pieces) -- $80 ($100) Lego Ideas: Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory (2,025 pieces) -- $176 ($220) Lego Mario Kart: Piranha Plant Power-Up Pursuit (588 pieces) -- $40 ($50) Lego Marvel: Spider-Man Mask (487 pieces) -- $56 ($70) Lego Marvel: Peter Parker's Apartment (394 pieces) -- $44 ($55) Lego Sonic: Shadow the Hedgehog (720 pieces) -- $56 ($70) Lego Star Wars: Wicket the Ewok (1,010 pieces) -- $104 ($130) Lego Star Wars: AT-AT Driver Helmet (730 pieces) -- $56 ($70) Lego Wicked: Glinda &amp; Elphaba Bookends (1,327 pieces) -- $104 ($130) Lego Icons: Holiday Wreath (1,194 pieces) -- $80 ($100) Lego Botanicals: Evergreen Collector's Set (599 pieces) -- $48 ($60) Lego Classic: Cool Creative Box (510 pieces) -- $24 ($30) Lego Super Mario: Peach's Garden Balloon Ride (453 pieces) -- $50 ($60) Target-exclusive Lego sets on sale now (December 2025)Now's the ideal time for deals on the 487-piece Marvel Spider-Man Mask and the 720-piece Shadow the Hedgehog model. Both of these sets are retiring soon, and the Lego Store is already sold out of the Spider-Man Mask. Sonic the Hedgehog fans should also check out Amazon's deals on Sonic sets before they're gone--multiple of the discounted sets retire soon, too. Spidey fans can also save on the 394-piece Peter Parker's Apartment playset. A bunch of Target's deals are on fairly new Lego releases. For instance, fans of adorable furry creatures from film history can get the 1,125-piece replica of Gizmo from Gremlins for $88 (was $110) and the 1,010-piece Wicket the Ewok from Star Wars: Return of the Jedi for $104 (was $130). Gizmo launched October 1, and Wicket released in August. The other Star Wars set on sale is the 730-piece AT-AT Driver Helmet for $56 (was $70). Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Turok Trilogy Bundle $30 (was $40) See at Amazon See at GameStop See at Target See at Walmart A few years ago, Nightdive Studios resurrected the classic Nintendo 64 FPS series, Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, with enhanced remasters on PC and consoles. While all three games in the series were originally released as standalone digital editions between 2018 and 2023, they were recently collected into the physical The Turok Trilogy Bundle, which launched for PS5 and Nintendo Switch on October 31. And now, just a few weeks since launch, the collection is up to $30 off at multiple online retailers. GameStop currently has the best deal, offering the PS5 and Switch editions for just $28 (was $40). Meanwhile, Amazon, Target, and Walmart are all selling the game for $30. Just note that the deal is selling out fast--in fact, the Switch version is already sold out at Walmart, so grab the deal quickly before it's gone. Turok Trilogy Bundle $30 (was $40) The Turok Trilogy Bundle includes Nightdive's remasters of the first three numbered series in the Turok series, including: Turok: Dinosaur Hunter Remastered Turok 2: Seeds of Evil Remastered Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion Remastered Each game in the collection features upscaled graphics with dynamic lighting and enhanced water effects, modern gameplay tweaks, and more. The full data for all three games is included on the disc and the Switch cart. The Switch version is also playable on Switch 2. See at Amazon See at GameStop See at Target Nightdive's Turok Remaster trilogy is also available digitally, but this deal does not apply to the digital releases. The original Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, based on the Valiant Comics series, launched in 1997 for the Nintendo 64 and Windows, becoming an instant classic in the FPS genre. The game was followed by two single-player sequels, Turok 2: Seeds of Evil and Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion--both released on Nintendo 64. The trilogy follows various warriors who take up the mantle of Turok--warriors who protect Earth and a parallel dimension known as the Lost Land from prehistoric monsters, high-tech super soldiers, and inter-dimensional aliens. The series also features the multiplayer deathmatch spin-off for N64, Turok: Rage Wars, and the prequel entry, Turok: Evolution, which launched on GameCube, PS2, Xbox, and PC in 2002.

    "description": "After two and a half years, eleven seasons, and one massive, game-changing expansion, Diablo 4's Age of Hatred is finally coming to a close. Announced as part of 2025's The Game Awards, Diablo 4's next expansion, Lord of Hatred, marks the end of the game's ongoing saga--one which has seen Lilith, Inarius, Mephisto, and the humans of Sanctuary engage in an epic struggle to gain control of the world and its future. But while the upcoming expansion promises a \"satisfying\" conclusion and an \"epic, final showdown\" with the game's big bad, Mephisto, it also promises a number of other exciting features, too. Prior to the expansion's announcement, GameSpot, IGN, and PC Gamer were invited to attend an exclusive interview with two key members of Lord of Hatred's narrative team: lead narrative designer Matt Burns and narrative designer Eleni Rivera. The pair were eager to answer our questions about Lord of Hatred, even those that were, admittedly, both thirsty and bizarre. We left the Q&amp;A session with a better understanding of Mephisto's plans, the lore behind the revamped Paladin class, and the Skovos Isles, as well as a great deal of anticipation--anticipation for more personality-filled dialogue options, plenty of \"Jedi mind tricks,\" and the return of Amazons, Lilith, and Ralph Ineson's velvety voice. IGN: Vessel of Hatred felt like you guys were holding your breath. Was that a Band-Aid or a part of the story that you always wanted to tell? I'm sure you guys heard a little bit of the feedback that Vessel of Hatred was good and also felt like it was teasing out of the showdown that we were all really waiting for. I'm wondering how much of that was planned versus you guys just taking longer to produce this big showdown. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
