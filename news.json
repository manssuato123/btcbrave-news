    "description": "It's not an easy life for Sanctuary's citizens in Diablo 4, but players can make things a little brighter in the upcoming holiday event Goblin Greedings. Starting on December 18, players will be to put presents under their tree--so to speak--by clobbering creatures for loot and bringing a little hope back to Estuar. To claim their prizes, players will have to face hordes of Treasure Goblins and earn their place on the March of the Goblins reputation board. There are multiple tiers to unlock, and players can claim their prizes between each one by visiting the Goblin Square in Kyovashad. Once players complete the final tier, they will be given a Resplendent Spark. That final tier is repeatable, and the quality of the loot dropped by enemies will increase with each tier. However, players will only have until January 6, 2026 to work their way through and claim as much treasure as they can. Returning Grim Favors during Goblin Greedings will also give players an additional cache for Gift of the Tree. All they need to do to claim it is to select a cache, which will reveal the treasure they've been given by the Gift of the Tree. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The 4K restorations are accompanied by new bonus features and archival content as well as multiple posters, a booklet with new commentary, trading cards, and more collectibles. Arrow Video's limited editions are actually limited, so once TMNT Trilogy sells out, any future printings won't include the collectibles. If you need a holiday gift for a TMNT fan, Amazon's store page says Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Trilogy will arrive with a few days to spare (as of December 16). The TMNT Trilogy is also available on 1080p Blu-ray, but it's actually more expensive than the 4K Blu-ray edition at the moment. Fans can also get the newly restocked TMNT: Mutant Mayhem 4K Steelbook Edition for $25.89 and the recently released TMNT: The Last Ronin Graphic Novel Box Set for $60.90 (was $95).

    "description": "Fanatical is closing 2025 out with a new build-your-own bundle deal, the Best of Platinum Collection. This deal offers a selection of various acclaimed PC games featured in the various Platinum Collection bundles throughout 2025, giving you a chance to pick up some excellent games for cheap. Like Fanatical's other build your own bundle promotions, you can pick as many games from the list as you'd like, and the more games you buy, the more you save. To start, you can pick up to four games for $3.33 each. At five or more games, you'll pay $3 per item. Grab 10 or more games, and you'll pay just $2.90 per game, and if you want the full 22-game bundle, it'll run you $63.78, a $547.75 value--not too shabby for literally thousands of hours of entertainment. See bundle at Fanatical One of the items you can pick, the SteamWorld Classic Bundle, comes with four games: SteamWorld Dig, SteamWorld Dig 2, SteamWorld Heist, and SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech. So, really, if you decide to add this to the Best of Platinum Collection, it could be a total of 25 games. The list of possible games also includes the strategy game SteamWorld Build as another pick, in case you want to load up on even more of the series. With season 2 of the Fallout TV show looming, now's the perfect time to explore the open-world RPGs that inspired the show with Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition and Fallout New Vegas: Ultimate Edition. Both are available as part of the Best of Platinum Collection. These versions include the full base games plus every update, add-on, and DLC expansion. You can round out the selection with Fallout 76, which is an online multiplayer take on the series--though it still offers the same open-ended, first-person exploration and RPG gameplay as the other games. It also recently received a new Burning Springs DLC update that ties into the Amazon Prime Video streaming series. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

You don't need to extract to complete Groundbreaking, but you'll receive the Blue Gate Communication Tower Key upon accepting this request, so you need to bring it into the raid with you. As such, you'll want to bring an augment with a safe pocket so that you don't accidentally lose this key during your journey to Pilgrim's Peak. If you do lose it, you'll have to wait to find another one (which is entirely random) or just hope you can catch the door open from someone else's key at some point.
