    "description": "Arcade1Up NBA Jam Deluxe Cabinet $350 (was $500) See at Amazon See at Best Buy See at Kohl's See at Macy's See at Walmart Nostalgic NBA Jam fans can save big on Arcade1Up's home arcade machine featuring the classic 2v2 basketball game. Earlier this month, the NBA Jam Deluxe Arcade Cabinet was on sale for an all-time low price of $400 (was $500). The price dropped an additional $50 in the days leading up to Christmas. As of December 28, NBA Jam Deluxe is up for grabs for onl $350 at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Kohl's, and Macy's. If you purchase NBA Jam Deluxe from Kohl's for $350, you'll also get $70 Kohl's Cash to use online or at your local store from December 29 to January 4. The NBA Jam Deluxe Cabinet isn't the only Arcade1Up machine on sale for a great price at Amazon and Best Buy. We've included a list of the best Arcade1Up deals at the bottom of this story. Arcade1Up NBA Jam Deluxe Cabinet $350 (was $500) The NBA Jam Deluxe Cabinet is preloaded with three classic arcade basketball games developed by Midway from 1993-1996: NBA Jam, NBA Jam Tournament Edition, and NBA Hangtime. The control deck has two sets of inputs: one arcade stick and three buttons for each player. In addition to local multiplayer, you can play against users around the world over Wi-Fi. Like other Deluxe editions from Arcade1Up, it has a 17-inch HD display, light-up marquee, dual stereo speakers, and a faux coin door on the front. The cabinet is roughly 61.5 inches tall, just under 19 inches wide, and weighs approximately 62 pounds. If you want to sit while playing, Amazon has a limited-time deal on this popular adjustable bar stool with a backrest. Arcade1Up has manufactured several NBA Jam cabinets over the past five years, but the Deluxe Edition is the only model in stores today. Outside of Arcade1Up cabinets, NBA Jam has been dormant for nearly 15 years; the last home console entry, NBA Jam: On Fire Edition, released on PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2011. Thankfully, Arcade1Up's NBA Jam cabinet offers an authentic way to revisit the best entries in the series. See at Amazon See at Best Buy See at Kohl's NBA Jam debuted exclusively in arcades in 1993 and was ported to consoles the following year. The Tournament Edition, which launched in 1994, is essentially an updated and expanded version of the original NBA Jam. As the name suggests, the main addition was Tournament mode. It's still 2v2 basketball, but Midway added a third player to each team, allowing you to make substitutions throughout each game. The Tournament Edition also expanded player stat categories.

    "description": "Is there a more infamous monkey-paw wish than the collective dream that all our favorite games could last forever? Well, the finger curled, because it seems like all major game publishers in the world only want to make games that go on to infinity. With the rise of live-service games, it's been a struggle to know when to put the controller down, especially when games like Fortnite release seasonal content like The Simpsons season pass that ask you to play long enough to unlock stupid sexy Flanders. Luckily, for us, episodic games, perfectly portioned into bite-sized morsels, have come back to rescue us from the endless grind. In this case, I am talking specifically about Dispatch, the new episodic superhero game from AdHoc Studio. If the name is unfamiliar to you, AdHoc is a new game company founded by former members of Ubisoft, Night School, and perhaps most notably, Telltale Games, who blew up the episodic gaming scene with 2012's The Walking Dead. The studio would later close due to a variety of factors internal and external, some of which I covered previously as a reporter. But by then, the episodic-games formula was starting to feel a bit played out, and the mood appeared to be shifting towards either more complete single-player experiences, or the early live-service games we know today.

    "title": "In The Switch 2's First Year, Every Third-Party Port Tells A Story About The System",
    "description": "In November 2017, Bethesda Softworks and port specialists Panic Button performed what seemed like a miracle: They released a Switch port for id Software's recent reboot of Doom. The game, a famously fast-paced, intense shooter with modern graphics, seemed ill-suited to Nintendo's handheld and its capabilities, but despite some visual blurriness and a reduction in the frame rate, the game held up well on the hybrid system. In GameSpot's 8/10 review of the Switch port, Peter Brown praised the game as \"an impressive port that begs you to consider gameplay over graphics.\" Doom was the first Switch \"impossible port,\" a colloquial term that players took to using whenever a third-party game designed for much more powerful hardware arrived on the Switch in pretty good shape. Over the course of the system's lifespan, it would receive many more so-called impossible ports, including versions of Wolfenstein 2: The New Collossus, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, The Witcher 3, No Man's Sky, and Ace Combat 7--large, visually-intensive, action-heavy games, all of them translated to the system with immaculate care. Seeing how the Switch handled these games was always exciting--even when the ports were less-than-ideal, there was still something special about seeing them run on a handheld from 2017. Prior to the Switch 2's launch this year, Nintendo, in typical fashion, did not tell us much about what the Switch 2 was capable of on a technical level. We knew that the new 7.9-inch 1080p screen was capable of displaying gameplay at up to 120fps and was HDR-compliant. Nvidia announced that the system's custom chip would allow for DLSS, which is capable of upscaling games regardless of native resolution, and that the new system would be, of course, much more powerful than the old one. For early adopters, though, the system's first six-plus months of availability has involved a lot of curiosity over what the system can and can't do, speculating on what games the system could or couldn't handle, and pondering just how close these ports can come to other console versions.

    "description": "Earth Directorate Commander Ash was sent to settle a labor strike issue on behalf of Auntie's Choice, in an effort to gain favor with the corporate conglomerate. A bit of an outlaw, and someone who excels in shooting, lockpicking, and smooth-talking, I felt like my character was primed to work out a result that was favorable for the workers without too much of an issue. I was able to enter the closed-off facility and even nab some blackmail on the manager in charge before confronting her directly about the labor strike. I conveyed the workers' demands, and expected to be able to convince her to see things my way--after all, I invested a decent amount of points in speech. It quickly became clear that no amount of talking was going to solve this dispute. As far as the manager was concerned, any concessions she might make would prevent the factory from hitting its quota. Someone with engineering or hacking skills may have been able to solve this issue by messing with the equipment in the factory, but my character wasn't built for that. My character was good at three things, and I'd already exhausted the lockpicking and talking options. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy's Enormous Size Was A Huge Risk - But It Paid Off",
    "description": "55 hours into The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy, Too Kyo Games' visual novel turn-based strategy game, I encountered a particularly touching scene. Two characters, who a few days earlier learned something particularly shocking--one of several moments in the game that recontextualizes the whole experience--get up early and end up watching the sun rise together. It's a little moment of tranquility, of two people bonding over natural beauty amid a particularly rough string of days, and it landed beautifully. It felt like the game was tapping into something a little deeper, a little more melancholic, than what I'd seen before. According to online estimates of the game's total length, at the point I saw this scene, I had another 90-120 hours to go until I could really say that I'd \"finished\" the game, depending on my speed and patience. The name The Hundred Line refers to the number of days the students of Last Defense Academy have to defend their school for as waves of invaders periodically force them into tactical combat. But the name actually has another meaning that you uncover once those 100 days pass for the first time, about 30 hours into the game: This game has 100 unlockable endings, and to get the full picture, you'll want to see all of them. The promise of 100 endings feels like the sort of marketing mistruth that pops up in a press release to play up how much the game is shaped by your choices. A game that claims to have 12 endings might actually mean four endings, each with a few minor potential variations. And yes, some of the endings in The Hundred Line are kind of cheating, or are very similar to each other--not every ending is created equal. But there really are 100 of them, consisting of 21 different \"routes\" that can all end at various different points. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

That's what console commands are for. Like any big crafting game should, Satisfactory has a variety of console commands available. Continue on for how to use those commands, and what cheats are available. Before we dive in, cheating in Satisfactory isn't as simple and straightforward as we might hope. There are a variety of console commands available, but most of them pertain to user preferences. To use actual cheats, you'll have to install a mod. How to use Console Commands Look at the upper-right corner of your keyboard. You should see a key that has one or more of these characters: ~, `, or §. That last one is pretty standard on a lot of European keyboard layouts. Pressing this will bring up the console. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Satisfactory: How to Use the Awesome Sink and Awesome Shop",
    "description": "The holy grail of Satisfactory is having a perfectly balanced factory, where everything made is used, with your storage emptying at the same rate it's being depleted. But that's not going to happen--you'll have extras. That's what the Awesome Sink is for. What is the Awesome Sink? The Awesome Sink (with Moody Lighting)The Awesome Sink is a building that exists to get rid of all of your extra stuff, rewarding you with tickets based on the complexity of the items. This building is entirely optional, but those tickets can be used in the Awesome Shop to buy things like new cosmetic building parts, walkways, vehicles, and more. There's some really useful stuff in there, so you'd be a fool not to put one up. See the official Satisfactory wiki page on the Awesome Shop for a complete list of available items and ticket values. How does the Awesome Sink Work? You can dump items into the Awesome Sink as quickly as conveyor belts can supply them, so if you have a production line that's pumping out materials at ultra-high volume just for this purpose, the Awesome Sink is ready. You can build multiple Awesome Sinks around your factory, the points they generate are universal to all Sinks, and you can print out your tickets from any Sink at any time. So it's smart to have a Sink in various areas of your megafactory, taking in extra items and turning them for profit. The higher complexity the item, the more points it will generate toward your next ticket. Further, tickets become more expensive with each one generatedFor example, an Iron Ingot generates just two points, while a Crystal Oscillator generates 3,072.

    "title": "Taming Satisfactory Lizard Doggos For Fun And Profit",
    "description": "Everybody needs a friend, and that's especially the case in Satisfactory, where it's just you against all of nature and capitalism. Thankfully, the Lizard Doggo is there to keep you company. And even if you prefer your alone time, there's a good reason to keep a pen of Lizard Doggos around. Lizard Doggos are short, friend-sized lizards with dog-like features. They have a physique similar to that of a Beagle, but are scaled and have armor on their back. Untamed, Lizard Doggos are entirely harmless, and will quickly run when approached if done so carelessly. To tame a Lizard Doggo, you'll need a few Paleberries--the raspberry-like fruit found all over the map. If you already have Blade Runners by this point, unequip them before you try to tame one of these little guys, and toggle your movement speed to slow (Shift key). Find a Doggo and wait until it turns and starts staring at you. At this point, open your inventory and drop a Paleberry on the ground in front of you and wait. The Doggo will slowly approach you to eat the Paleberry. Make sure not to move during this process. Once the Doggo has completely eaten the Paleberry, slowly approach it. You should have a prompt to pet it (E). If you're able to pet it, you're golden--you have a new buddy. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
