Players will be able to take control of four of the iconic characters from the show--Rick Grimes, Daryl Dixon, Negan, and Michonne--with The Walking Dead stars Andrew Lincoln and Norman Reedus reprising their roles as Rick and and Daryl, respectively. The first trailer for the crossover should look very familiar to fans of both franchises. The new episodic campaign will unfold over three stories that revisit locations from The Walking Dead, including Grady Memorial Hospital, the Prison, and the Alexandria Safe Zone. But don't count on facing The Walking Dead's infamously slow hordes of walkers. This DLC is pitting the characters against a new incarnation of World War Z's Zeke swarms. There's also a fresh take on a Zeke called Spiked Walkers. This zombie is impervious to melee attacks unless it's been knocked over. However, the window of opportunity to take it out is short, and once it's back on its feet, it's no longer vulnerable. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "While it's always a good idea to save some cash toward the end of the month, Valve's quarterly Steam sales make it very tempting to dip into those rainy day funds. Fortunately, knowing when these sales will occur has gotten easier over time, as Valve no longer keeps people guessing about the dates. The company regularly posts the dates far in advance for its sales and promotional events, and for the upcoming Steam Winter Sale 2025, this will kick off on December 18 and runs through January 5, 2026. Beyond that, Valve has also dated several other events for the rest of the year, ranging from a fresh batch of demos being dropped in the February Next Fest to a spring sale starting in March. There'll also be promotions with specific focuses throughout the year, highlighting mystery, tower defense, and PvP games. Here's the full list of everything on the way.

    "description": "Following its decision to sue Tencent for creating a \"slavish clone\" of its Horizon games, Light of Motiram, Sony has concluded its legal battle with the company. The game is no longer listed on Steam or the Epic Games Store, and the court case has been dismissed. That's according to new court documents filed earlier this week, and Tencent added that it has reached a \"confidential settlement\" with Sony Interactive Entertainment. \"SIE and Tencent are pleased to have reached a confidential resolution and will have no further public comment on this matter,\" head of communications for Tencent Americas, Sean Durkin, said to The Verge. Announced last year, Light of Motiram was quickly compared to Sony's Horizon series as it featured a very similar art direction and tone to the post-apocalyptic sci-fi series developed by Guerrilla Games. Both games featured vibrant environments and animal-like robots, and Sony was quick to file a lawsuit. Sony and Tencent eventually began discussions to resolve the dispute, with Sony demanding that Tencent pause all public promotion or testing for Light of Motiram. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Players can get all of the different types of ore in The Forge using your various pickaxes, and some of The Forge codes that are kicking around may be able to help with that. That said, with dozens of ores available in the highly popular Roblox experience, it can be quite confusing where to find all of them.

Now, developer Battlestate Games has revealed that the game has sold over 1 million copies in the month following release. Unlike some early access titles, participating in Escape from Tarkov's beta required a purchase of one of the game's various pre-order editions, so the post-release sales will mostly represent newcomers to the game. Battlestate Games controversially required that players re-purchase the game if they wanted to play it on Steam, even if they already purchased it directly from Battlestate. Escape from Tarkov also saw some controversy around its sales strategy when the studio revealed a $250 pre-order edition that unlocked access to an exclusive PVE mode, and other features that players called out as pay-to-win.

    "description": "Crystal Dynamics announced Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis last week at The Game Awards, calling it a reimagining of the original 1996 Tomb Raider. While the studio wants to stay faithful to the original, it has also said it plans to tone down the brutal difficulty of the nearly 30-year-old PlayStation 1 game. Speaking in a press conference, as reported by GamesRadar, Crystal Dynamics developer Will Kerslake was asked about adapting the original PS1 game specifically when it comes to difficulty. Like many games of its era, the 1996 game was known to have its punishingly difficult sections, including insta-kill death traps that were often near-impossible to avoid without the benefit of hindsight. \"Part of reimagining a game right is adjusting that game evolving for modern player tastes,\" Kerslake said, and though he doesn't explicitly mention difficulty it seems safe to say that Legacy of Atlantis will have far fewer insta-kills. That doesn't mean the game will be a walk in the park, however. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
