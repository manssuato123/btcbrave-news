    "title": "Another Store Bans This New Indie Game, And The Developer Has Questions",
    "description": "Late last month, Santa Ragione, the developer behind the indie horror game Horses, revealed that its title had been banned by Steam in 2023 while the game was still in development. The game had been set to release on Epic Games Store this week, but now Epic has banned Horses as well. Santa Ragione shared a lengthy statement on its site, as well as reproduced messages from Epic that broke the news about the cancellation a day before launch. The dispatch from Epic cites violations of its inappropriate content policy and hateful or abusive content policies. Epic also stated that Horses got an Adults Only rating, and those games are excluded from the store. In response, Santa Ragione mentioned that Epic approved the game for release just over three weeks ago, and that the actual rating for the game was M for Mature under the ESRB and PEGI 18 in international territories. The studio went on to explain again that Horses is not a sexually charged adult game. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Features A New Samus Aran Voice Actor",
    "description": "Samus Aran might not be known as a chatty character, but a voice actor helps flesh out the heroine with grunts and mumbles. Jennifer Hale, probably best known as Commander Shepard in the Mass Effect trilogy, previously provided the voice for Samus in the first three Metroid Prime games. But for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, Erin Yvette voices the protagonist and Krystle Martin provides the motion capture, per Nintendo Life. This isn't the first time Yvette has worked with Nintendo. Her previous experience with the company includes voicing Neilnail in Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition and Great Fairy Cotera in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. Meanwhile, IGN asked Hale about reprising her Metroid Prime role recently, and the actress seemingly implied she wasn't involved this time. \"I don't know,\" Hale said. \"I have no recollection of recording it or signing a contract, so it could be no.\" Hale has been on the flip side of this before, too, with Bayonetta 3. She isn't the first voice actor replaced by Nintendo in recent years. In June, longtime Princess Peach and Toad voice actor Samantha Kelly revealed she was no longer playing those parts after not being involved with Mario Kart World. In 2023, Super Mario Bros. Wonder introduced a new voice for Mario and Luigi--Kevin Afghani. This came after Charles Martinet stepped back from voicing the iconic character following a 25-year stint.

But beyond its own hardware, Valve's support of open-source emulation projects may have laid the groundwork for playing your favorite PC games on Arm devices like mobiles and tablets--no ports necessary. Valve's upcoming Steam Frame headset is the company's first Arm-based device, making use of the open-source FEX emulator to run Windows-native games. As it turns out, Valve has had more of a hand in FEX's development than it initially appeared. In an interview with The Verge, Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais revealed that Valve actually initiated the FEX project, and has been largely responsible for its development. \"We were talking with a few developers that we knew were the right fit for an undertaking like that, a long-term thing that needed a very specific set of experts,\" Griffais explained. \"We worked hard on trying to convince these guys to start the project, and have been funding them ever since.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",
