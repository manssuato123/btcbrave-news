Mega Lucario Z marks the game's first Z Mega Evolution--a new kind of Mega-Evolved form that has a shorter cooldown period, but depletes Mega Energy much more quickly. According to the official Pokemon website, \"Pokemon that undergo Z Mega Evolution require less time to fire off moves after receiving the orders from their Trainer, but they also burn through their Mega Power very quickly, making them less suited for long battles.\" Like the original Mega Lucario, Mega Lucario Z is a steel and fighting type. Where this form differs, however, is in its defense and speed stats. As the official Pokemon website explains, \"While Mega Lucario concentrates its aura into a destructive force, Mega Lucario Z uses it to surround its entire body, cloaking itself to increase its defense, flexibility, and agility.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "A new report has shed more light on the CEO succession plans at Disney, with a story from The Wall Street Journal saying leading candidate Josh D'Amaro wants to focus more on gaming. The same report also suggested that Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson is not going to get the job. It was previously reported that Disney's board considered external candidates to take over for Bob Iger, including Wilson. But the new report said Disney is likely to choose an internal candidate. Wilson, for his part, is staying on with EA amidst the company's $55 billion sale. The new Disney CEO could be D'Amaro, who is currently the current head of Disney Experiences--a sprawling unit that covers theme parks, consumer products, cruise ships, and video games. The WSJ report said D'Amaro--who is \"widely considered\" to be named the next CEO--wants to give video games \"a bigger role at the company.\" The report said D'Amaro is also looking to integrate \"gaming technology\" into Disney's creative processes. No further details were divulged, however. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Five Nights At Freddy's 2 Is So Scary, Matthew Lillard Thought It Would Get An R",
    "description": "This week, Five Nights At Freddy's 2 is heading to theaters to see if it can scare up a box office return comparable to the original film's $297.1 million worldwide take. Apparently, it's already scared returning star Matthew Lillard enough to believe that the sequel could have gotten bumped to an R rating. \"It's funny, Matthew Lillard saw the movie the other day and he called me and he was like, 'It's so scary… Is this still PG-13?,'\" related director Emma Tammi during an interview with Dexerto. Tammi noted that the sequel does have a darker tone than its predecessor, but she wanted it to be PG-13 so younger fans could watch it as well. \"I think the audiences that maybe wanted the first one to go to scarier places will be really satisfied,\" added Tammi. \"We wanted to be inclusive of the younger audiences, and at the same time, we don't want to limit how dark and scary it can feel for the older audiences.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

If we sold even 200,000, that would be really, really great. If we sold, like, 100,000, that's not so good.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "After 120 Hours In Arc Raiders, I Finally Killed Another Player",
    "description": "The Arc Raiders Achievement/Trophy for killing another player in PvP combat is titled \"Crossing The Threshold,\" and after 120 hours of intentional pacifistic gameplay, when I saw that alert come across my screen, I felt like I had done exactly that: I'd waded into uncharted territory. More than that, I'd found myself in a world I didn't even want to be in. I'd prided myself on never killing another player in the game. Through dozens and dozens of rounds, I'd gone well out of my way to avoid such an outcome, often being slow to shoot first, even to my own detriment. I put my trust in other players, and sometimes it would prove unwarranted. Mostly, I'd resorted to diplomacy, often talking my way out of problems with other players I'd encounter. I had so many big ideas about what it takes to return to Speranza without blood on one's hands. To me, Arc Raiders was this exciting social experiment. How long can I effectively talk down other players who means me harm? In the end, the answer was about 122 hours of play. The fateful encounter occurred on Stella Montis, which will be no surprise to some Arc Raiders veterans. This newest map, and the first to take place entirely indoors, is an ultra-tense setting where you are either diligently checking your corners or you're soon bleeding out on the ground. Even in solo queues, where Arc Raiders remains mostly the bastion of good-natured and helpful PvE-only players, it feels like Stella Montis is kill-or-be-killed more than the game's other maps.

    "description": "YouTube has published its list of the top trending topics of 2025, and once again, gaming and pop culture were popular choices for what people watched on the video-streaming website. Out of the trending topics--which aren't ranked in any particular order--US YouTube viewers devoured any content related to the Switch 2 console, Roblox, and the RPG-strategy game Cookie Run Kingdom. Other topics of interest in the US included KPop Demon Hunters, Labubu collectible dolls, and the hit anime series Blue Lock. Roblox user-generated experiences and the Switch 2 continued to be popular topics on YouTube worldwide, especially in countries such as Korea, Germany, Mexico, France, Japan, and the United Kingdom. YouTube says that it determined the top trends for the US and other regions through \"a variety of signals,\" including views, uploads, and creator activity around the topics. Only the topics that were determined to have had conspicuous popularity this year--either because they were new to 2025 or because they saw significant increases in their user-interest metrics--were eligible for the list.
