    "description": "After two and a half years, eleven seasons, and one massive, game-changing expansion, Diablo 4's Age of Hatred is finally coming to a close. Announced as part of 2025's The Game Awards, Diablo 4's next expansion, Lord of Hatred, marks the end of the game's ongoing saga--one which has seen Lilith, Inarius, Mephisto, and the humans of Sanctuary engage in an epic struggle to gain control of the world and its future. But while the upcoming expansion promises a \"satisfying\" conclusion and an \"epic, final showdown\" with the game's big bad, Mephisto, it also promises a number of other exciting features, too. Prior to the expansion's announcement, GameSpot, IGN, and PC Gamer were invited to attend an exclusive interview with two key members of Lord of Hatred's narrative team: lead narrative designer Matt Burns and narrative designer Eleni Rivera. The pair were eager to answer our questions about Lord of Hatred, even those that were, admittedly, both thirsty and bizarre. We left the Q&amp;A session with a better understanding of Mephisto's plans, the lore behind the revamped Paladin class, and the Skovos Isles, as well as a great deal of anticipation--anticipation for more personality-filled dialogue options, plenty of \"Jedi mind tricks,\" and the return of Amazons, Lilith, and Ralph Ineson's velvety voice. IGN: Vessel of Hatred felt like you guys were holding your breath. Was that a Band-Aid or a part of the story that you always wanted to tell? I'm sure you guys heard a little bit of the feedback that Vessel of Hatred was good and also felt like it was teasing out of the showdown that we were all really waiting for. I'm wondering how much of that was planned versus you guys just taking longer to produce this big showdown. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

As detailed in a new PlayStation Blog post, the Stories Untold content update will see players head to the western part of the Chornobyl Anomalous Zone after picking up an emergency transmission. The new area will feature seven new locations, six new characters, and several hours of new content, GSC Game World said. GSC Game World said players will want to pay \"close attention\" to the Red Forest region on the map, and from there use their intuition and rationality to see how deep this particular irradiated rabbit hole goes. Other points of interest in the Red Forest GSC Game World said will be worth players' time are the Fairy Tale Pioneer Camp and the Old Mine. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Sega Channel launched in 1994 and was one of the first subscription-based, digital game services, beaming new games and content directly to players' consoles through a television cable. The service shut down in 1998, and since then many of the exclusive games and content available on the service were thought to be gone forever. That is, until the Video Game History Foundation embarked on a quest to see the channel's unique history, and its content, preserved. Alongside former Sega Channel VP of programming Michael Shorrock and a passionate Sega fan who had acquired a collection of Sega Channel backup tapes, VGHF sought to tell the full story of the Sega Channel.

Preorders for the It: Welcome to Derry Limited Edition Steelbook sold out within an hour at Amazon, but you can still secure a copy for $40 at Gruv. We also expect Walmart to open preorders soon. If you're a Stephen King fan, it'd probably be wise to preorder ASAP. Steelbook Editions of the two-part It film adaptation sold out fast, and Welcome to Derry is the first TV series based on a Stephen King novel to get a 4K Blu-ray edition. At this time, the Limited Edition Steelbook is the only way to get the series on 4K Blu-ray. Welcome to Derry: Season 1 is available to stream in full on HBO Max. Alternatively, you can buy Season 1 on other streaming platforms like Amazon Prime Video for $22. Welcome to Derry holds an 80% on Rotten Tomatoes, and I think many longtime fans of King's legendary horror novel would say Season 1 was pretty great. HBO has yet to renew the series for a second season, but director Andy Muschietti has a three-season arc in mind. Season 1 tells the story of Pennywise's reign of terror in 1962. Season 2 would rewind the clock 27 years to Pennywise's previous feeding cycle in 1935, and Season 3 would be set in 1908. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

On the Ubisoft website, the patch notes highlight the bloody new finishers, saying they \"bring more flair to your encounters.\" The official Assassin's Creed account on YouTube shared a video--seen below--showcasing the gruesome maneuvers for Naoe and Yasuke. The new update also brings quite a few improvements to the recently released Switch 2 edition of Assassin's Creed Shadows.

For anyone unaware, Kingmakers is an action-strategy game set in medieval times that allows players to use AK-47s, grenade launchers, and attack helicopters in battle. The game is developed by Redemption Road Games and published by tinyBuild. It was due to launch in October this year before being delayed indefinitely due to its \"incredibly ambitious\" setup. Kingmakers is among the top five most-wishlisted games on Steam. So far, it's only been announced for PC. Deadline reported that Netflix bought a movie pitch for the game, with writer Christopher MacBride (Flashback, The Conspiracy) attached to write the script. The report added that Stranger Things director Shawn Levy's production company, 21 Laps, is producing the Kingsmakers movie, while Story Kitchen's Dmitri M. Johnson, Michael Lawrence Goldberg, and Timothy L. Stevenson are also producing. Story Kitchen is also behind the Sonic movie series, along with the upcoming Tomb Raider and Life is Strange TV shows, among other gaming projects. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Paladin is finally playable in Diablo 4, and after a weekend with the ARPG's newest class, it's clear the holy-magic wielding warrior is a force to be reckoned with and more than just a copycat of its Diablo 2 counterpart, even if I personally wished it leaned into its namesake a little more. After two and a half years of waiting, Blizzard shadowdropped Paladin for Diablo 4 during a reveal for the game's new Lord of Hatred expansion at The Game Awards. Preordering the expansion grants early access to the Paladin, with the full expansion also set to add a second, still unannounced class. Diablo 4's Paladin is a fascinating mix of old and new. While the class bears the Paladin name from Diablo 2, it arguably shares just as much, if not more, in common with the Crusader from Diablo 3, with a number of similar abilities and over-the-top holy magic.
