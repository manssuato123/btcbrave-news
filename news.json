    "description": "The Nex Playground is probably the most popular video game console in the US that most people don't even know exists. Case in point: Circana senior director Mat Piscatella has revealed that the cube console focused on motion controls has topped every single PS5 and Xbox SKU for units sold in the US for a holiday week. Nex Playground - The Active Play System $249 See at Amazon See at Walmart See at Target See at Best Buy On BlueSky, Piscatella posted the possibly shocking video game hardware statistics for the week ending November 22. The top-selling hardware option was Switch 2 bundled with Mario Kart World, with the Nex Playground at No. 2. Meanwhile, the PS5 Slim digital edition with 1TB came in third place. Obviously, there are multiple options when choosing a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S--various bundles and hard drive configurations--and each one represents a SKU. So one caveat with Circana's info is that the list isn't showing overall Switch 2, PS5, or Xbox Series X|S units sold. US best-selling hardware SKUs for week ending Nov 22, 2025, ranked on units sold: 1) NS2 Mario Kart World Bundle 2) NEX Playground Interactive Gaming System 3) PS5 Slim Digital 1 TB So that's neat. Source: Circana Retail Tracking Service — Mat Piscatella (@matpiscatella.bsky.social) December 3, 2025 at 5:25 PM In fact, this isn't the first time Nex Playground has upped Sony's system in the US for a short time. In July, the cubed console went on sale for Prime Day and sold more units over the past month than any PS5 option on Amazon. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

About halfway through the trailer, Blizzard invites players to \"make new memories\" and shows an outdoor wedding ceremony complete with fireworks and a wedding ring. That might not be much just taken on its own. After all, players have held unofficial role-play weddings in WoW since its earliest days. However, one player in the trailer's comments on YouTube asked \"Did you guys just secretly announce player weddings?\" to which Blizzard gave this cheeky reply. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Sega Says It Will \"Leverage AI\" In Game Development When Appropriate",
    "description": "Sega has decided that now's the time to join the myriad other companies in the games industry adopting artificial intelligence to streamline their development processes. In response to a question about combating ballooning game development budgets, per VGC, Sega executives said during a Q&amp;A session after the company's Q2 financial results presentation that it will use the most efficient development methods available. If that happens to be AI--which is becoming increasingly popular in the games industry as of late--then that's what Sega will use. It just won't be everywhere all of the time, apparently, but it will be there. \"Rather than fully following the trend toward the large-scale development, we will also pursue efficiency improvements, such as leveraging AI,\" the company said. \"However, as AI adoption can face strong resistance in creative areas such as character creation, we will proceed by carefully [assessing] appropriate use cases, such as streamlining development processes.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

He said in a new interview that he doesn't have much experience playing the Fallout games, but he's well-versed in the Fallout lore thanks to YouTube videos. \"I'm very familiar with the lore,\" the Home Alone star told IGN. \"For sure. I've less hands-on experience with the games themselves, but that being said, I knew what I was walking into. When we [Culkin and actress Brenda Song] were watching the show, I would pause it for her and catch her up on like, 'Oh, that's what this means, or that means, or that kind of thing.' Even some of the subtle subtext of the show.\" Culkin, 45, said he's too busy these days to try to play video games, so he \"watched a lot of YouTube stuff\" for Fallout.

Sorry to disappoint, but can confirm Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time won't be at TGA this year 💖 — Prince of Persia™ (@princeofpersia) December 3, 2025 In June, Ubisoft noted that the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake is set to launch by March 31--the end of the company's current fiscal year. That was the second time Ubisoft stuck to that release timeline, too. However, it's been a bumpy road for the game since being announced in 2020. For instance, in 2022, the Prince of Persia remake switched developers to Ubisoft Montreal, the original team behind the Sands of Time series. Before that, Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai were working on the title. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Audio changes tested in a recent Battlefield Labs mini-test will be deployed with the upcoming update, with the overall aim to prioritize the most important combat and vehicle sounds. The audio refresh includes a \"comprehensive pass\" on footstep audio that aims to make footstep sound effects more tactically useful to players who can hear it. The update also includes some improvements towards ongoing performance issues that sometimes cause important sounds not to play as intended, an issue that's especially prevalent on large maps. Rush and Breakthrough are also getting some balance changes designed to improve the game mode's flow, and even out the win rate between attacking and defending teams. Seige of Cairo, for example, will get a few boosts to the attacking side, including one more attacker tank in Sectors 1 and 3, and an updated capture area on B. Rush attackers are also getting a small boost, with changes to M-COM locations on Manhattan Bridge and Liberation Peak. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
