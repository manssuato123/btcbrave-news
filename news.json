So far in 2025, numerous developers lost their jobs, Microsoft canceled games, and the industry further consolidated with EA announcing plans to sell itself to Saudi Arabia. Speaking to The Game Business, Keighley said the introduction of the Game Changer award in 2024 was an initial attempt to address this. Amir Satvat was given the prize for his work to support people who were laid off in the gaming industry. Keighley hasn't said if this award is coming back in 2025, but it would be a glaring omission if it did not. In any event, Keighley said walking the line between celebrating games and acknowledging current circumstances is no easy task. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "After 25 years of being exclusive on console to Xbox, Microsoft's Halo series is headed to PlayStation in 2026 with Halo: Campaign Evolved. With the year coming to a close, Sony has published a video highlighting some of the \"must-play\" titles coming to PS5 in 2026, and Halo got a special shoutout in the video, while GTA 6 was not mentioned. Seeing Halo promoted so heavily by Sony would have been unthinkable not long ago, and the comments on the video reflect this. The top comment on the video states, \"Seeing Halo here is still surreal.\" Someone else said, \"It feels so weird seeing Halo being advertised by PlayStation.\" Others have pointed out that Rockstar's GTA 6 is not mentioned in the video, with people taking this to mean, or suggest, that Sony is concerned that Rockstar could push the game to 2027. But there could be any number of reasons why GTA 6 was left out. Rockstar, after all, is highly protective of its own game assets. To be sure, it is a giant leap to say that GTA 6 not being featured in video means the game won't make it out on time in 2026. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Purnell has been vocal about her dislike for Lucy's \"poop finger,\" but it's coming back for Season 2. While speaking with IGN, Purnell offered a more positive assessment of Lucy's mismatched finger. \"I'm very fond of my poop finger,\" said Purnell. \"It's the thing that is the Wasteland that Lucy carries with her. It's quite literally a piece of the Wasteland. Some random ghoul's finger that she's now got stuck.

As players prep for this month's upcoming Expedition--an optional wipe that resets much of their progress in exchange for in-game rewards--they'll also be treated to the fresh Cold Snap update. This new content includes an additional snow-based map condition, a premium Raider Deck, and another event to complete for goodies. Here's everything we know about it so far. Table of Contents [hide]Cold Snap release date Cold Snap release date Arc Raiders' Cold Snap update will release on December 16, 2025. While we don't know an exact launch time for this update yet, the previous North Line update launched at 1:30 AM PT / 4:30 AM ET, so it's safe to assume this one may also launch in the wee hours of the morning for US-based players. The Cold Snap update falls just one day before the Expedition window opens, which will allow players to send their raider off and reset much of their in-game progress any time before December 22. This should give dedicated players at least a few days to see this fresh content on their current raider before sending them off and starting anew. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

But rather than fix the ability to send houses skyward, Blizzard is instead embracing it. When housing first arrived on December 2 as part of patch 11.2.7, it didn't take long for players to discover that, while the UI didn't show it, houses could actually be lifted off the ground using keybinds. The result was players making all kinds of airborne housing creations, including elaborate treehouses, airships, mechs, homes held up by kites, and everything in between. In a forum post, WoW community manager Randy Jordan (aka Kaivax) stated that instead of fixing the ability to elevate houses, Blizzard has with this week's scheduled maintenance actually made it easier by enabling proper controls to move houses upward.
