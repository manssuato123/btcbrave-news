Anime skins are clearly popular, so it makes sense that more are coming. Next up is Bleach, the beloved show that began in the 2004, and which is currently running a revival series to finish telling the manga's story, called Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War. This first collaboration with Bleach will, according to posters that have been spotted in the wild, include four skins: Ichigo Kurosaki, Rukia Kuchiki, Orihime Inoue, and Uryu Ishida. And presumably at least one gigantic sword. Message received.I can feel it.Something is coming… pic.twitter.com/wpifS7zyvD — Fortnite (@Fortnite) December 14, 2025 We have no further details about the collab, which has only been teased by Epic rather than fully revealed. But since this collab will be released during the holidays and Fortnite's Winterfest event, there's a decent chance there will be some kind of Bleach component added to Battle Royale, Blitz Royale, or Reload, since Fortnite has included tons of mythic weapons and powers based on anime series in the past--particularly at the end of the year.

    "description": "Developer Vedinad has released the Spooky update for Megabonk, bringing a new map, character, and bosses. The patch notes also point to a laundry list of bug fixes and balancing adjustments. The Spooky update was initially \"going to be a small Halloween update,\" according to Vedinad on Steam. That checks out, per the free DLC's name, but the developer added the desire \"to make it a bit bigger.\" As such, the update is arriving for the festive season, with the Megabonk account on X promising a \"new meta.\" Megabonk launched in September, sharing similarities with Vampire Survivors and Risk of Rain. It's a roguelike game where you do your best to survive against an onslaught of enemies on randomized maps. While doing so, you level up and find various items. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Last month, Matthew McConaughey became one of the most prominent actors to endorse artificial intelligence by signing a deal with AI company ElvenLabs that will allow it to utilize his voice. McConaughey is also lending his voice to Exodus, an upcoming sci-fi title from BioWare veterans at Archetype Entertainment. But given the timing of McConaughey's new deal, Archetype co-founder Chad Robertson wants players to know that the actor really is lending his voice to the game. \"Everything that's in Exodus ... is bespoke VO recording just for us,\" Robertson told Eurogamer. \"He has a completely separate deal of his own design that he's worked out with Elevenlabs, which happens to be one of the most prominent, AI voice-generation tools, that is being used by other video game companies. Such that people could leverage his voice in non-bespoke VO sessions in a different way. He has a bunch of really strict rules around how it could be used.\" Robertson went on to note that Archetype is not using generative AI in the production of its game, but added that using it in the future is a possibility under the right circumstances.

    "description": "At The Game Awards, Lucasfilm and Mass Effect veteran Casey Hudson announced a brand-new Star Wars game called Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic. It was one of the biggest, most unexpected reveals from the event, and people are pretty hyped for it. The game is in early development and still a long way off (but reportedly due before 2030), and there is plenty we still don't know about pretty much all facets of the game. But for now, here's what we know so far about Fate of the Old Republic. We will continue to update this post as more details become available. Table of Contents [hide]When will Fate of the Old Republic be released? When will Fate of the Old Republic be released? Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic does not have a release date. Immediately following the game's announcement, people theorized that the game was a long way off, in part because Hudson only just started the studio making the game, Arcanaut, back in July 2025. His previous studio, Humanoid Origin, opened in May 2021 and closed in December 2024; the studio never released a game. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Now, Camilla Luddington--who voiced Lara in the 2013 Tomb Raider reboot, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider--has shared her farewell to Lara as well as a nod to her successor. In a post on her Instagram account, Luddington thanked Tomb Raider fans for their support and sent Wilton her best wishes. \"To join the list of Lara Crofts before me was an incredible honor and she will forever be a part of me,\" wrote Luddington. \"The Survivor Trilogy was a decade of adventure I will never ever forget. I could not be prouder of what we created. And as always, a new actress receives this incredible gift to step into the boots. So with that said, [Alix Wilton Regan], if you’re ever in need of a [crossbow], I know the exact spot to look for one at Croft Manor.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic was one of the big highlights of The Game Awards last week, but will it launch before 2030? Game director Casey Hudson has stepped in to address these reports--which may stem from Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier's speculation about when the game will be released--confirming that the spiritual successor to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic will arrive before the current decade is up. \"Don't worry about the 'not till 2030' rumors,\" Hudson wrote online. \"Game will be out before then. I'm not getting any younger!\" There's no concrete release date yet for Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, and it's still very early days for the project. The reveal trailer at The Game Awards was a CGI teaser for the game--similar to how Quantic Dreams revealed Star Wars Eclipse at The Game Awards 2021--and the developer behind Fate of the Old Republic is Arcanaut Studios, a company founded by Hudson and his partners in July. While it's not impossible, properly staffing a new studio and developing a game expected to be a AAA Star Wars experience will be challenging. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
