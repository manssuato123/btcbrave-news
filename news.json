After selling out in the lead-up to Christmas and again on New Year's Eve, the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Minifigure 6-Pack is available for $30 at Amazon on January 1. Resellers have been selling Spider-Verse mystery boxes for around $50, so Amazon will probably sell out again soon. While you're on Amazon, you should also check out the newly released Miles Morales Mech vs. Spider-Man 2099 Lego set, which is only $15 and is also based on Across the Spider-Verse; it's one of 12 new Lego Marvel models and playsets available at Amazon. If you're interested in collecting this Lego minifigure series, now's the time to grab a box or two. Spider-Verse minifigures are sold out at all other major retailers and the Lego Store. Most retailers sold out shortly after the collection launched in September and never restocked the mystery boxes or singles. And with the new Lego Minifigure Animal Series 28 Collection now available, it's unlikely the Spider-Verse minifigures stick around for much longer. The Spider-Verse Lego minifigure collection includes 12 characters from the animated film series. Each minifigure comes with a stand and most also have an accessory. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

See at Amazon See at Best Buy See at Lego Store Eight new Harry Potter Lego sets launched this week at Amazon, the Lego Store, Best Buy, and other major retailers. Longtime fans of the franchise will want to pay special attention to the 25th Anniversary sets. To mark the anniversary of the Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone film adaptation, Lego designed five models and playsets that call back to the 2001 movie. The star of the lineup is the Lego Harry Potter 25th Anniversary Sorcerer's Stone Collector's Edition, a 1,571-piece display model featuring iconic characters, objects, and scenes from the movie. The new $170 Collector's Edition set is already on backorder at the Lego Store, but it's in stock at Amazon and Best Buy. If you have a My Best Buy Plus/Total membership, you'll save 10%, which drops the price to $153. The Sorcerer's Stone Collector's Edition will remind fans of the Hogwarts Icons Collector's Edition from Lego's 20th Anniversary celebration in 2021. Both models feature Hedwig and numerous objects fro the first movie. The 3,010-piece Hogwarts Icons set is officially retired and regularly sells for well above its original $300 price, so it's worth keeping that in mind if you're interested in the new model.

    "title": "The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy Is The Ultimate \"What If\" Game",
    "description": "At the beginning of 2025, I fully believed I had grown tired of stories about multiple timelines. During the past decade, the Marvel Cinematic Universe pushed the classic comic book narrative device into the mainstream, fueling a film conglomerate with legally approved cameos, flashy visuals on the silver screen, and loose plots that, eventually, came together for one final pay-off. While the concept of the multiverse has been explored in film and TV even before Marvel's takeover, it quickly became the narrative foundation of choice. When done right, the potential is undeniable--works like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and Everything, Everywhere, All at Once are heartwrenching displays of interpersonal relationships, making characters face the reality of what-if scenarios, reconciling with their choices and what could have been if they had turned the other way instead. But you can only hear the same tune so many times before it starts to lose its original impact. It wasn't until The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy that my interest was reanimated. The visual novel and strategy-RPG hybrid presents itself as deceivingly linear, only to push you into a completely different story structure at the very end. It makes for a sprawling web of outcomes based on your choices, all while showcasing different perspectives on events and characters that weave absurdity and sentimentality in equal measure in a showcase of creative prowess from the development team.

    "title": "Best Of 2025: Avowed's Most Controversial Feature Is Also One Of Its Best",
    "description": "Obsidian's Avowed is one of the better action-RPGs released in 2025. While it doesn't reinvent any particular wheel, it benefits from an engaging campaign, fun combat systems, and charming characters. Aside from the occasional bug--a common element of Obsidian's open-world games--and an overabundance of homicidal bears, I liked nearly everything about the game. That includes Avowed's most controversial game mechanic: enemy respawns, or the lack thereof. When it comes to RPGs, players often think of a few key elements. Some sort of leveling system, quest-granting NPCs, obtainable loot that bolsters certain \"builds\" or playstyles--you know, the basics. One feature that's common but maybe not as notable, considering its use in other genres, is respawning enemies. Players often expect areas to repopulate with baddies whenever they return to a given location. Avowed isn't about that life though--at least, not entirely. Avowed is designed to respond to your actions in meaningful ways, and not just during key moments, where certain decisions can change the direction of the game's story. This also applies to Avowed's enemies. Essentially, most of the outlaws, walking mushrooms, and crazed bears you'll run into during your journey, won't return after being killed. Laid waste to a group of Xaurips while wandering through the forest? Don't worry. They'll still be dead on return trips. Slain a few dozen Spiderlings in an underground lair? They won't be resurrected anytime soon, either. Rinse and repeat--or rather, don't repeat. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Tom and Jerry: The Golden Era Anthology (Blu-ray) $46.79 (was $60) Get deal at Amazon Tom and Jerry: The Golden Era Anthology is on sale for a nice discount at Amazon. The newly released Blu-ray collection is up for grabs for $46.79 (was $60). The Golden Era Anthology compiles over 100 classic animated shorts starring the iconic duo. The six-disc box set also comes with a wealth of bonus features and a physical sketchbook. The Golden Era Anthology is also available on DVD for $46.79 (was $55), though it doesn't include the bonus content disc or sketchbook. Warner Bros. released The Golden Era Anthology on December 2 to celebrate Tom and Jerry's 85th anniversary. Unsurprisingly, this awesome collection quickly became a bestseller when preorders opened in September. Though Amazon's store page notes a $60 MSRP, the retailer has listed the collection for as high as $66.49. Amazon previously offered the $46.79 deal in mid-December, but it disappeared within a day. Tom and Jerry: The Golden Era Anthology (Blu-ray) $46.79 (was $60) Part of the Warner Archive Collection, The Golden Era Anthology features 114 theatrical shorts across six discs. The shorts were restored in 1080p resolution and support DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0. Three of the shorts have stereo audio, while the rest are mono. The box set collects nearly 20 years of Tom and Jerry history. The animated shorts, which played before feature films, originally appeared in theaters from 1940 through 1958. All 114 shorts are presented in chronological order, and three of them--Casanova Cat, Mouse Cleaning, and His Mouse Friday--were completely remastered for the first time. The Golden Era Anthology's sixth disc is loaded with bonus content, including audio commentaries narrated by animation experts, featurettes, and extra shorts. Two of the featurettes are exclusive to this release: Lady of the House: The Story of Mammy Two Shoes and Animal Hijinks: The Friends and Foes of Tom. The included physical sketchbook features archival character art and designs. Special Features 20 audio commentaries 9 classic featurettes 2 new featurettes 3 bonus animated shorts 32-page sketchbook All told, The Golden Era Anthology includes approximately 20 hours of content. The cover art features Tom in his Zoot suit from the 1944 animated short The Zoot Cat. Get deal at Amazon Tom and Jerry: The Golden Era AnthologyThe Golden Era Anthology is notable for including two remastered shorts that had never received home media releases in the US: Mouse Cleaning and Casanova Cat. These are controversial Tom and Jerry episodes due to them being racially insensitive, and while they were scheduled to appear in Tom and Jerry: The Golden Collection Volume Two, that release was ultimately canceled. Older--and extremely dated--content like this has appeared in several other Warner Archive releases over the years, as the company has added disclaimers to these shorts to indicate their historical context, problematic nature, and racially insensitive jokes.
