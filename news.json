The lists contain quite a few familiar faces--like Fortnite and Minecraft--but Balatro stands out for 2025. That's because the game not only shows up on the paid mobile charts, but it's also No. 3 for Apple Arcade--the subscription service. Fortnite is No. 2 for free iPhone games and No. 3 for free iPad games. The battle-royale title finally returned to iOS in May in the US after roughly five years, as developer Epic Games and Apple engaged in a lengthy legal battle.

A follow-up to 2021's Hell Let Loose--which was inspired by the conflicts of World War 2--players will have to once again rely on tactical teamwork to survive. Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will feature six new maps on launch day, each described by Expression Games as a mix of dense jungle, twisting deltas, and deadly open areas. You won't just be fighting on the ground either, as military helicopters serve multiple roles. From troop deployment to fire support, reconnaissance, and tactical drops, they're an invaluable tool in any match. Players can also engage each other in naval combat, as heavily armed vessels such as the iconic US patrol boat and the PBR will be featured in the game. Maps are also riddled with tunnel networks constructed by the North Vietnamese army, and these offer strategic advantages for surprise attacks and troop movements. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

However, it appears the still-unnamed shooter isn't completely dead, according to Romero himself. During his appearance at Salón del Videojuego de Madrid (via Eurogamer), Romero confirmed that the project is back on, and that it's been given a fresh redesign. \"We're not starting at ground zero,\" said Romero. \"We can take pieces out of and put into a brand-new indie game.

Revenue came in at $821 million, compared to $860.3 million during the same period last year, and short of Wall Street projections. Profit, however, soared from $17.4 million last year to $77.1 million for the latest period. GameStop's stock price sank after the earnings report came out, with many saying the revenue miss was to blame for the falling price. Others, however, have said GameStop's strong profit-growth, along with having more than $8.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (up from $4.6 billion last year) is a sign of health. Additionally, GameStop's Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&amp;A) costs were $221.4 million for the quarter, down from $282 million during the same period last year.
