Publisher Inin Games had previously explained that switching the entire run to standard cartridges would have resulted in manufacturing costs increasing by \"at least\" €15 per game copy, which is why it chose the Game-Key Card option. Inin Games pledged to look for a way to release the full game on a Switch cartridge, leading to today's news about the costs increasing, but not as much as it anticipated.

Toto and Harding-Rolls told GI.biz that they believe the game's standard edition will cost between $70 and $80, but the game's deluxe editions could come in at $100 or more. Some have theorized that GTA 6 could be $100 for its standard edition, and Video Game Insights analyst Vic Bassey said, \"If there was any game likely to cross the $100 threshold,\" it would be GTA 6.

The two companies formed a joint venture, Sony Honda Mobility, in 2022 to produce electric vehicles. Their first car, the Afeela 1, will be released next year and it will include the capability of playing PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 games. However, this a limitation to what players can do with their Afeela In-Vehicle Infotainment systems. Sony and Honda aren't including in-car consoles, and they are relying on PlayStation Remote Play for this to work. That means Afeela 1 owners will also need to have either a PS5 or a PS4 at their homes in order to connect with the systems to play games. Sony notes that this use of Remote Play is separate from streaming PS Plus games from the cloud. The Afeela In-Vehicle Infotainment system.This setup includes integrated display and premium audio systems for passengers. It's unclear if the cars come with a PlayStation controller or if players have to bring their own from home. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "It's almost the end of 2025, and in the spirit of Spotify Wrapped, several big companies have invited subscribers to review their last year of activity. Sony got the ball rolling with the PlayStation Wrap-Up, Steam offers a similar annual roundup, and the Nintendo Switch Year in Review recap has been announced for early next year--but where is Xbox in the middle of all this? While it doesn't offer an Xbox wrap-up every year, it still feels odd for Microsoft's gaming brand to skip 2025. The year has seen several high-profile releases from the company and the launch of an Xbox-branded handheld gaming PC alongside Asus, but according to Windows Central, Microsoft is allocating its marketing budget toward celebrating several major anniversaries in 2026. The Xbox brand celebrates its 25th anniversary next year, Blizzard has its 35th anniversary to look forward to, and Bethesda is turning 40. Those are several significant milestones in proximity to each other, and it's a safe bet that Microsoft wants to accommodate them, possibly explaining the lack of an Xbox Wrapped this year. On top of that, we'll see the return of BlizzCon in September, and Blizzard has teased its \"biggest year yet\" for 2026. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Generative AI has been at the forefront of the conversation for the past few years, with companies becoming divisive on how to implement it, if at all. Larian CEO Swen Vincke recently kicked a hornet's nest after saying the studios' developers use generative AI tools for things like exploring new game ideas, developing concept art, creating placeholder text, and for PowerPoint presentations. After a quick retraction and explanation, along with sharing that the studio was in fact growing its pool of artists rather than shrinking. Vincke has admitted that Larian uses AI for tasks nobody wants to do, but does AI--even at the concept art stage--help actual concept artists? According to a handful of video game concept artists, it can actually make things harder. Talking to Edmond Tran from This Week In Video Games, artists said that it complicates their workflow and doesn't help them creatively. \"I'm seeing more and more clients generate something approximating their desired outcome and essentially asking me to make 'something like this,'\" said Paul Scott Canavan, an artist who has worked as an art director and concept artist for projects like Destiny 2, Heroes of the Storm, Guild Wars 2, and Netflix's The Witcher. \"It sucks. This practice absolutely invalidates the entire creative process, in my opinion, and makes my job harder and more frustrating. The job of an illustrator or concept artist is to draw from their years of experience to interpret a brief in a creative way.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Cross's exit comes just after the game was finally announced for a March 2026 release, following an indefinite delay prompted by underwhelming player feedback on the shooter's alpha tests. Cross's departure from Bungie was tipped by an update to his LinkedIn page and social accounts, and he confirmed to Kotaku that it was his choice to leave. \"I’m super proud of the project and what the team accomplished over the last six years,\" he said, reflecting on his exit. After years of work on Destiny as lead concept artist, Cross returned to Bungie in 2020 to help shape the visual style for Marathon. The extraction shooter is looking to be one of Bungie's most visually unique titles, with a bold aesthetic named by Cross as \"graphic realism.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Ohlen's exit comes just after the studio debuted a flashy new trailer at The Game Awards, as he says he feels his work on the game is done. Ohlen has headed up the Wizards of the Coast-owned studio since its founding in 2019, working on the studio's debut title Exodus. \"At this stage, James felt his work on the game was complete and that the polishing and tuning were in great hands with the team,\" Hasbro said in a statement given to Bloomberg. Exodus is still fairly far from release, which is currently scheduled for early 2027. This is an unusually long window if the game is already up to the polishing and tuning stage. Just last week, Exodus received an epic new trailer at The Game Awards, focused on the journey of protagonist Jun Aslan. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Riot has said the refresh will include a brand-new \"around-game\" client, entirely new visuals for Summoner's Rift, and a better experience for players new to the game--plus more updates yet to be announced. Bloomberg initially reported on Riot's plans for a 2027 LoL refresh earlier this week, saying the update was internally known as \"League Next.\" Shortly after that report was released, Riot Games confirmed the plans via a video posted to League of Legends' social media. League boss Andrei Van Roon added that the video was intended to be released in January, but had been pushed forward in response to the report.

First and foremost is a brand-new \"around-game\" client, which will be bundled in with the game as a single application. Summoner's Rift is also due for an overhaul, with the studio promising \"entirely new visuals\" for the classic map, as well as some new gameplay. Other gameplay updates will include changes to runes and the pre-game experience, as well as a full overhaul to the learning experience for players new to League of Legends.
