For a limited time, the Evercade EXP-R handheld and VS-R home console are discounted to $105 (was $130) each. Both systems are bundled with Tomb Raider I-III Collection on cartridge. These are the first Evercade hardware deals in the US all year. Both systems had been sold out for much of the year until Amazon replenished its inventory in September. Since Amazon is Evercade's only US retail partner, we wouldn't expect these Black Friday deals to remain in stock for long. Blaze Entertainment recently launched $120 editions of the Evercade EXP-R and VS-R that aren't bundled with Tomb Raider, so it wouldn't be surprising if the bundles are gone for good after this sale.

At the time, some sources noted that Microsoft put a \"hold\" on production rather than a full cancellation. But now, Contraband's fate appears to be sealed as mass layoffs at Avalanche have resulted in the closure of its Liverpool studio. Avalanche announced the news on its official site, and disclosed that it means 31 developers are losing their jobs. Per United Kingdom labor laws, Avalanche initiated \"a collective consultation process\" in September before moving ahead with the layoffs and closing the studio. However, the rest of the company remains intact. \"The exceptional talent, passion, and commitment from everyone leaving have impacted every project,\" reads the message from Avalanche. \"We are truly grateful for the dedication and invaluable contributions to Avalanche Studios Group. Our focus remains on supporting the [staff] through this transition and to carry on making great games for our player communities.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Why Half-Life 3 Rumors Are Intensifying Again",
    "description": "Over two decades have passed since Half-Life 2 was released, but its developer, Valve, has never gotten around to making Half-Life 3. Instead, Valve has been busy turning Steam into the top marketplace for PC game sales (and making a VR spin-off that won our GOTY award). But every once in a while, rumors about Half-Life 3 flare up, and it's happening again right now. As noted by Kotaku, Valve's Steam storefront says that it has two upcoming games, but only Deadlock is listed, and that title is still in early access. The Game Awards are also coming soon, and there almost always seems to be speculation that Half-Life 3 will debut there. Some fans have also read a little too much into The Game Awards' post celebrating today's 27th anniversary of the original Half-Life. 27 years ago today, Valve released HALF-LIFE, it's first game. pic.twitter.com/9d13MAyAmB — The Game Awards (@thegameawards) November 19, 2025 For the record, The Game Awards makes that same post on this date every year. But that's never stopped the speculation before. Dataminers have also been snooping around in Valve projects, and claim to have found evidence of an unannounced shooter codenamed HLX. More recently, Valve unveiled Steam Machine and Steam Frame, and fans have noted that Half-Life 3 would probably help the company sell a lot of hardware. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "From a distance, the new twelve-sided tower rising in Phoenix’s Arts District looks like it belongs in a futuristic cityscape--or maybe in the middle of a very enthusiastic geometry lesson. However, ask the designers and they'll tell you there's a wink and a nod to a certain beloved racing game: Mario Kart. \"To build buildings that are unique that people stop and say, 'Hey, what is that?' I think is important to any downtown,\" said Zac Cohen, creative director at Räkkhaus, the architectural firm behind the project, to Fox 10 in Phoenix. In other words: If you think this building looks quirky now, just wait until you learn what inspired it. The complex takes its name from a famously chaotic, candy-colored racetrack known for sending players plummeting into the void, Rainbow Road. Obviously, you won't see any characters or trademarked symbols on the exterior--a strategic choice, given a certain company's well-known legal enthusiasm--but the references are there if you know where to look and if you look hard enough.
