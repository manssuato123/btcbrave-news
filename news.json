Pokemon TCG collectors can also pick up the newly released Mega Venusaur ex Premium Collection for $74.89 at Amazon. Released earlier this month, the latest Mega Pokemon Premium Collection has been difficult to find in stock, so we wouldn't be surprised if it sold out again soon. Speaking of Premium Collections, the Lugia ex &amp; Latias ex Premium Collection is back in stock for $100. Amazon also has a brand-new Pokemon TCG listing that has yet to be noticed by resellers.

    "description": "Donkey Kong and Pauline Amiibo $20 (was $30) Get deal at Amazon Donkey Kong fans can grab the Donkey Kong Bananza Amiibo for $20 (was $30) at Amazon right now. This is a Lightning Deal with limited quantities. At the time of writing, over 20% of the available Donkey Kong and Pauline Amiibo figures have been claimed. Amazon also has deals on two Amiibo figures that launched alongside the Nintendo Switch 2: Yunobo from The Legend of Zelda and Jamie from Street Fighter 6 are available for $8 each. Meanwhile, GameStop has all seven Switch 2 Amiibo launch figures for $6 each. The Legend of Zelda: Yunobo Amiibo -- $8 ($30) Street Fighter 6: Jamie Amiibo -- $8 ($40) Donkey Kong Bananza: Donkey Kong and Pauline -- $20 ($30) Donkey Kong and Pauline Amiibo $20 (was $30) Based on DK's wide smile, we imagine he's punching his way to a Banandium Gem. He's also moving fast because Pauline's legs are dangling in the air. The uneven ground beneath DK's feet aligns with rocky terrain found in Ingot Isle, Lagoon Layer, and other locales from the game. As for its functionality in the game, scanning the Donkey Kong and Pauline Amiibo grants two main perks. You can unlock Pauline's Diva Dress a lot earlier in your adventure with the Amiibo. The Diva Dress doubles the likelihood of enemies dropping music discs. To unlock the Diva Dress, you need to talk to the NPC shaped like the Amiibo in the Resort Layer. The NPC will ask you to show them the Amiibo to claim your reward. Without the Amiibo, this particular outfit is locked behind post-game challenges. Scanning the Bananza Amiibo also spawns gold KONG letters that can be smashed to refill Bananergy. KONG tiles can also be spawned by scanning older Donkey Kong Amiibo figures. Get deal at Amazon Nintendo Switch 2 Amiibo Deals at GameStop As mentioned, GameStop is selling all four The Legend of Zelda Switch 2 Amiibo, the three Street Fighter 6 Amiibo, and the Street Fighter 6 Amiibo Card Starter Set for only $6 each as part of its last-minute holiday sale. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo Tulin -- $6 ($30) Sidon -- $6 ($30) Yunobo -- $6 ($30) Riju -- $6 ($30) Street Fighter 6 Amiibo Jamie -- $6 ($40) Luke -- $6 ($40) Kimberly -- $6 ($40) Street Fighter 6 Amiibo Card Starter Set -- $6 ($40) All Donkey Kong Amiibo Figures King K. Rool Amiibo (Donkey Kong) $18 (was $20) Preorder at Best Buy Most Amiibo figures featuring Donkey Kong characters are out of print, but King K. Rool received a Best Buy-exclusive reprint in September. Normally $20, Best Buy is selling the figure for $18. King K. Rool is the priciest preowned Amiibo in the series sold at GameStop, so fans who are interested in adding King K. Rool to their collection should snag one from Best Buy sooner rather than later. GameStop has two older Donkey Kong Amiibo for $18 each and two Diddy Kong Amiibo for $20 each. Amazon also has the Smash Bros. Series Donkey Kong Amiibo for $20, which would be its MSRP if reprinted today. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

But there's at least one publisher that's taken this criticism to heart by switching gears from This may be a welcome development for Nintendo Switch 2 players who hate Game-Key Cards back to cartridges, thanks to the new size options offered by Nintendo. Inin Games shared the news that its upcoming US and European run of R-Type Dimensions III is going to be released on a physical cartridge instead of a Game-Key Cards. The company also cited a recalculation of the production prices as a reason for the change. Apparently it's cheaper to release a game on Game-Key Cards, but the rumored measures taken by Nintendo apparently lowered the price for cartridges as well. Game-Key Cards have been in physical Nintendo Switch 2 game boxes, but those cards don't actually include any game data.

Bethesda's space-based game will receive an additional story DLC, it's just a matter of when. Now, a new report suggests that the delay of Grand Theft Auto 6 played a role in Bethesda's decision to push back its next Starfield chapter. According to Windows Central, Bethesda \"felt more comfortable\" about pushing Starfield's second DLC to the first half of 2026 because Microsoft already had a \"busy holiday period\" for 2025 without it. More intriguingly, the same report indicates that Bethesda has already been showing off the new update and DLC behind closed doors to a select group of players. One of the rumored changes is a revamp of the game's space flight systems that will actually make travel feel like a journey instead of a series of loading screens. Other aspects of space travel and exploration are also said to be improved in the new update, and the Creation Engine will reportedly include \"large technical improvements ... that will also carry forward to future games.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The company is already implementing such technologies \"mainly in the productivity areas\" and so far that's where the \"largest benefits\" have stemmed from, he explained, as reported by GamesRadar. A developer won't be able to use AI to make an entire game, though, and humans will remain essential to the process, he said. \"The benefits are real, they’re meaningful; but it's not a situation--and I'm unaware of such a situation--where AI could 'sit down and make games.' That's our take. It doesn't mean it's not gonna be useful, but it's not gonna be making The Witcher 5, or 6, or anything like that,\" Nowakowski explained. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Bravely Default Nintendo Switch 2 Remaster Gets First Discount At Amazon",
    "description": "Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster $30 (was $40) | Limited-time deal Get deal at Amazon Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster flew under the radar when it released exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2 as a launch title in June. If you're a fan of traditional turn-based RPGs made by Square Enix, we'd highly recommend checking it out--especially now that it has received its first discount. Amazon Prime members can get Bravely Default HD Remaster for $30 (was $40). This is a limited-time Lightning Deal. Bravely Default originally released on Nintendo 3DS in Japan in 2012. An expanded version of Flying Fairy arrived in North America in 2014, so the Switch 2 edition is technically the third iteration of the thoroughly nostalgic turn-based RPG. Bravely Default is one of the best games from the Nintendo 3DS era, and the remaster is great for newcomers and returning players alike. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "IO Interactive has been telling the story of Agent 47 for 25 years now, but soon the Hitman studio is about to embark on a new journey, with a character steeped in even more history. 007: First Light looks to take a new approach to James Bond by digging into his early life as an agent, while meeting some unique and colorful characters along the way. At The Game Awards, the game's first villain--the pirate king Bawma--was revealed, along with confirmation that actor and musician Lenny Kravitz will assume the role. Earlier in the year, IO confirmed that one of Bond's trusted associates, Dr. Selina Tan, will be portrayed by English actress Gemma Chan. GameSpot sat down with 007: First Light narrative director Martin Emborg to talk about the star power fueling his game, the potential pitfalls of revealing too much info too soon, and a little bit more about where Bond will run into Bawma during this adventure.
