    "description": "For three decades, the Tekken series has brought players together as they control of some of the best fighters in the world. Now, a 92-year-old Japanese woman named Hisako Sakai has carved out her own legend in the King of the Iron Ring battles by winning a Tekken 8 tournament. As reported by Automaton, the tournament of senior citizen Tekken 8 players was put on by the Japanese eSports association Care. The mission statement of that organization is to \"create an environment in which the elderly can casually participate in eSports.\" Care has been running tournaments since 2019 while treating them like a major event with livestreaming and official commentators. A video from the event can be seen below. Sakai made it all the way to the finals while playing as Claudio, when she went up against 74-year-old player Goro Sugiyama, who used Lili as his character. The match between Sakai and Sugiyama can be found two hours and 25 minutes into the video above. Despite the advantage of Sugiyama's relative youth, Sakai appears to have a superior button-mashing technique and enough mastery of the game to execute an effective path to victory.

But now, over a decade later, the Kinect-like Nex Playground has outsold Xbox hardware for November in the US, according to Circana. Nex Playground came in third for hardware units sold last month, outpacing Xbox Series X|S. The only saving grace is that Xbox raked in more dollar sales, as Nex Playground retails for $250 but has been on sale for $200 over the holiday season. Overall, video game hardware sales were pretty bleak, reaching a low not seen since November 1995. Top 10 Best-Selling Video Games Of All Time See More This might not be a total shock for those paying attention. Nex Playground actually outsold every PS5 and Xbox console bundle for a week last month in the US. The cube-shaped console features a camera to track body movements, similar to Kinect. Five games are pre-installed, with the option to purchase a subscription Play Pass for a larger library of games. It's $49 for three months or $89 for a year. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Prior to the release of Battlefield 6 in October and Black Ops 7 in November, industry experts predicted that Black Ops 7 would come out on top. But new data has arrived pointing to Black Ops 7's sales struggles, and now Mat Piscatella of Circana has told IGN that EA's game will likely be the best-seller. It would be just the second time since 2018 that a Call of Duty game would be outsold in the US. The last time it happened was 2023, when Hogwarts Legacy beat Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. Before that, Red Dead Redemption II came out on top in 2018, with Black Ops 4 at No. 2. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The battle for Warner Bros. may be down to Netflix and Paramount, but the studio has a clear favorite. Earlier this month, Netflix bid $82.7 billion dollars for Warner Bros., jilting Paramount in the process. Paramount responded with a hostile takeover bid of $108.4 billion. Now, Warner Bros. is urging its shareholders to reject Paramount's \"illusory\" offer. \"Following a careful evaluation of Paramount's recently launched tender offer, the Board concluded that the offer's value is inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on our shareholders,\" reads a letter to shareholders from Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr., the chair of Warner Bros. Discovery's board of directors. Although Paramount's offer is higher, Warner Bros.' contends that Paramount's owners, the Ellison family, didn't offer a \"full backstop\" commitment to provide the money to cover its offer and that it can walk away from the transaction without paying any penalty. By comparison, Netflix and Warner Bros. have a $5 billion breakup fee if their deal fails to close or meet regulatory approval. Warner Bros. also contends that the proposed Paramount deal will not be approved by regulators. Regardless, Netflix isn't guaranteed to be approved either. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Fallout 5 is one of the games currently in the works at Bethesda Game Studios. It's still years away from release, but now Bethesda boss Todd Howard has shared a small update about it. He told the BBC that Fallout 5 will be influenced in part by the popular Prime Video Fallout TV show. \"In short, yes,\" he said. \"Fallout 5 will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening. We are taking that into account.\" Fallout 76 has also been influenced by the TV series, and it gets new content based on the show, including Walton Goggins' character, The Ghoul. That game is free to play now through December 22, presumably to cash in on the debut of Fallout Season 2. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The 2013 reboot of Tomb Raider has found its way to several platforms over the years, but in 2026, Lara Croft is about to find herself shipwrecked on mobile devices. Tomb Raider is officially coming to iOS and Android devices on February 12, 2026, and it's priced at $20. This version of the game will also include all 12 DLC packs, adding more outfits, upgrades, and a bonus Challenge Tomb. Feral Interactive says the game has been \"expertly optimized\" for smartphones and tablets and will feature a customizable touchscreen interface. Controller support will also feature in this release, and supported devices will offer gyroscopic motion-aiming. You can preorder it now through the iOS App Store, or you can pre-register for it on the Google Play Store if you're using an Android device. Tomb Raider was a big hit when it arrived more than a decade ago, as it chronicled Lara Croft's first big adventure on the mysterious island of Yamatai. Two sequels followed it, Rise of the Tomb Raider and Shadow of the Tomb Raider. The franchise is also poised for a comeback, as two new games were revealed during The Game Awards.

    "description": "Down under may have just given us the down low on Dispatch coming to Switch and Switch 2. That's because the Nintendo storefront for Australia has listings up for the episodic game, revealing that the title is planned to launch January 29 on both Nintendo systems. There hasn't been an official announcement from Dispatch developer AdHoc Studio yet about Switch and Switch 2 ports. However, the official Nintendo eShop pages point to this being a matter of when, instead of if, Dispatch arrives on the hybrid consoles. So far, Dispatch is only available on PC and PS5. The Nintendo store listings note that there will be a free Switch 2 upgrade for Dispatch. That edition of the game sports \"enhanced resolution and improved frame rates\" and will take up an estimated 14.6GB of storage space. The listed price is $43.95 AUD--with a launch discount--but keep in mind Australian prices are usually higher than in the US. For example, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on Switch 2 is $109.95 AUD. In comparison, Dispatch costs $30 on Steam and PS5. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
