Also known as Overdose, OD is one of several games from Hideo Kojima and his team at Kojima Productions that we know about, and it's being made in partnership with Xbox Game Studios. Kojima has kept most details on OD under wraps, allowing the brief reveal trailer to do the talking for him and get fans of his work speculating on what he's cooking up right now. A few other details on the game have been revealed since it was first announced during the 2023 edition of The Game Awards. Here's a closer look at everything we know about OD so far. When will OD be released? A release date for OD hasn't been revealed yet, and we're expecting this game to be in incubation for a few more years before it sees the light of day. Kojima, who is now in his 60s, is keenly aware that he can only remain active in game development for as long as his body and mind holds out, but the veteran developer has promised to stay creative for as long as he is physically able to do so. OD trailer New Teaser Trailer The most substantial glimpse of the game was shared during a Kojima Productions live-stream in September 2025. In the new teaser trailer, OD’s backstory is shared in glimpses of redacted text that raise more questions than answers. From there, the video follows Sophia Lillis’ character as the events unfold from her first-person perspective. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Rockstar Games' Red Dead Redemption 2 has some moments of levity, but it's not a comedic farce. Or at least it wasn't until a modder found a way to bring the chaotic energy of Super Monkey Ball into game with Arthur as the monkey inside of the ball. YouTube host Blurbs recently fielded requests for Red Dead Redemption 2, including the aforementioned Super Monkey Ball mod. Before it could be finished, Blurbs had to work out how to put Arthur into a ball and and add gyroscopic controls and little bananas for Arthur to collect. But the crowning touch was to let the monkey ball unleash a path of destruction in its wake. I completely recreated Super Monkey Ball inside of RDR2. I asked popular streamers for mod ideas, so blame them. pic.twitter.com/WtltktmxYw — Blurbs (@Blurbstv) December 9, 2025 That was only one of the requests that Blurbs completed for the full video. Some of the others included the creation a gunicorn--a horse with a usable gun attached to their head--as well as a separate gun that can turn NPCs into horses, in addition to birds that target Arthur with their explosive poop. To cap it off, Blurbs activates all of the mods at once, which sends Arthur into Super Monkey Ball mode at very inopportune times. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Berseria follows Velvet Crowe, a young woman bent on vengeance after the murder of her brother. It's a deep, emotional tale of self-reflection and the power of letting go. Despite launching after Zestria, Berseria's prequel story is approachable even if you haven't played Zestria. In fact, like the majority of the Tales series, you can play Tales of Berseria without prior knowledge of the other games. It even seems like Bandai Namco plans for new players to start here, considering Zestria has not been remastered yet. With the cadence of remastered Tales games, it seems to only be a matter of time before Bandai Namco announces a remaster of Tales of Zestiria to give both new fans and veterans alike the complete story with modern improvements.

The patch notes address an issue where Oscar could become stuck in the starting area, and it also fixes the map's new LGM-1 Wonder Weapon, which could sometimes fire with unintended behavior when paired with certain GobbleGums and the Frenzied Fire augment. Unfortunately, this also affects a strategy players were using to help make the Wonder Weapon more powerful during the tough boss fight for Astra Malorum.
