The expansion marks the end of Diablo 4's ongoing story, culminating in an epic battle against the MMO-ARPG's biggest antagonist: Mephisto. Revealed as part of 2025's The Game Awards, Lord of Hatred sees players team up with an unlikely ally in an attempt to put an end to the Lord of Hatred's uprising. The expansion takes players to the fabled isles of Skovos, a region that was meant to appear in Diablo 3 before ultimately being cut, and serves as the former home of both Lilith and Inarius. In addition to finally taking us to these long-anticipated islands, Lord of Hatred also brings with it two new classes. While Blizzard has yet to reveal what one of these classes might be, they studio confirmed the fan-favorite Paladin is finally making their return. \"The Paladin rises as the realm darkens, wielding hammer, shield, and Holy Light to smite Mephisto’s demon army with righteous fury,\" Blizzard wrote in its press release. \"Through melee combat and divine abilities, the Paladin empowers players to strike with both unwavering faith and overwhelming force.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Surprisingly, there isn't just one game in production, but two. The new entry in the franchise is Tomb Raider: Catalyst, coming in 2027, while a total remake of the first title in the series arrives next year with Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis. Lara Croft's \"Survivor\" trilogy wrapped up in 2018 with Shadow of the Tomb Raider, but fans have seen enough iterations of the hero to know this wasn't the end for Tomb Raider. Alongside a new game, the franchise is also coming to Prime Video with Sophie Turner starring as Croft. Previously, the character has been played in live-action by Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander. Tomb Raider: Catalyst sees Lara heading to Northern India, where a mythical cataclysm has taken place. This draws the attention of all sorts of treasure hunters, and Lara must figure out who's friend and foe. Developer Crystal Dynamics is behind the all-new entry in the franchise, which is planned for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

It kinda rules.

Suddenly, that wild, eclectic cast, which includes the likes of Cody Rhodes as Guile, Roman Reigns as Akuma, and David Dastmalchian as M. Bison, doesn't seem as out-of-pocket as it sounded on paper.

The Nintendo Switch 2 version has been delayed, coming out sometime later in 2026. The new trailer also showcases not only more of the caped crusader in all of his Lego glory, but a glimpse at some of the other heroes lending him their talents, like Catwoman, Robin, Batgirl, and Nightwing. These characters also have special abilities based on their skills, such as Catwoman calling in a cat to take out a goon. There are also plenty of iconic Batmobiles and various other Bat-vehicles shown off, like the Batpod from The Dark Knight. The first solo Lego Batman since 2014's Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, this new adventure plays like a highlight reel of Dark Knight movies with a toyetic spin. The game also borrows from Rocksteady's Arkham series, as Batman utilizes stealth and timing-based combat to keep Gotham safe. While the system is designed to be approachable with expanded windows of opportunity to block attacks, experienced players can dial up the difficulty to experience a challenge worthy of the world's greatest detective.

Ella Mental can control earth, fire, wind, and water, and she uses all four elements in her offense.

    "title": "Street Fighter Movie Cast Revives Mortal Kombat Rivalry For No Real Reason",
    "description": "Like any awards show, there's bound to be a moment or two that leaves you perplexed about what's going on. The Game Awards had one such moment just like this, and it came during the reveal trailer for the upcoming Street Fighter film, which was quite chaotic and loud. Moments after Geoff Keighley introduced the Street Fighter trailer, the film's main cast took to the stage. Andrew Koji (Ryu), Andrew Schulz (Dan Hibiki), Callina Liang (Chun-Li), Cody Rhodes (Guile), David Dastmalchian (M. Bison), Jason Momoa (Blanka), Mel Jarnson (Cammy), Noah Centineo (Ken Masters), Olivier Richters (Zangief), Orville Peck (Vega), Rayna Vallandingham (Juli), Roman Reigns (Akuma), and Vidyut Jammwal (Dhalsim) all took the stage to yap about ... nothing much, really. That's not entirely true, sort of. Liang confirmed that the cast wrapped up filming Street Fighter \"a few weeks ago.\" Momoa--with a slight sway and a slight slur--cheekily argued with Koji over the pronunciation of \"Ryu.\" Koji said the cast was there to present the Best Ongoing Game Award (which Hello Games' No Man's Sky won). Schulz really sought applause by asking the audience to \"make some noise\" if they ever played the game in their life. Schulz, for some reason, then reignited the longstanding rivalry between Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter by inviting \"the whole cast of Mortal Kombat 2\" onto the stage (which didn't happen).

    "description": "Gang of Dragon, a new game from former Yakuza/Like A Dragon visionary Toshihiro Nagoshi, made its world premiere at The Game Awards, and it looks extremely similar to the Sega's own gangster franchise. The debut trailer shows a back-alley stabbing, a showdown in a bar, and plenty of action, with what appears to be South Korean actor Ma Dong-seok in the starring role. It all looked very reminiscent of the Yakuza/Like A Dragon franchise (and even has dragon in its own name). Gang of Dragon is said to be \"deep in development,\" but no release date was given. Nagoshi was a 30-year veteran of Sega who became best known for his work on the Yakuza/Like A Dragon franchise. He served as director of Yakuza/Like A Dragon studio Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios for a number of years before departing Sega in 2021. He then formed Nagoshi Studio in 2022, under the umbrella of Chinese publisher NetEase. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
