    "description": "Battlefield 6's 1.1.3.0 update is bringing the fog of war into winter. As part of the new Winter Offensive, players will be able to access a new version of the Empire State map called Ice Lock Empire State. This map will only be around for a limited time, but it swaps out the standard map with frozen streets and other examples of cold and hazardous weather. The new map will also have a themed event mode, allowing you to play Domination, Conquest, and Gauntlet mission variations that utilize the new \"Freeze\" mechanic. Players will also be given access to the ice climbing axe through the Winter Offensive Bonus Path. Once they have the axe, players can unleash it as a melee weapon on unlucky foes. That bonus path also features an 11-tier, time-limited reward track featuring event cosmetics, and XP Boosters. According to Battlefield Labs, the new update has \"a broad range of fixes and refinements across Battlefield 6.\" Some of the improvements include weapon reliability, vehicle behavior, and quality-of-life bug fixes. You can find the complete notes for this update below. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Path of Exile 2 players won't have to wait long for the next update. The Last of the Druids is arriving on December 12, and it's putting more than just the magic of the Druids at your command. Players will soon be able to transform their Druids into a wolf, a bear, or even a dragon-like wyvern. The teaser trailer below demonstrates the powers that each new form has to offer. The Druid's ability to transform is tied to one of three different talismans. As a wolf, players can summon a pack to attack enemies or rip adversaries to shreds with their own teeth and claws. Bears are raw power personified, and they can increase their strength through each roar they make. Becoming a wyvern grants the player the power of flight, as well lightning and fire attacks that can bring any adversary to their knees. Even as a human, Druids have formidable abilities to fall back upon. They can command earth and storm elements, which put thunder and volcano attacks at their fingertips. There will be two paths for Druids to ascend to. As a Shaman, Druid magic and spells are amplified to a staggering degree. The Oracle may be the second ascendancy class for the Druids, but it grants players the foresight to predict enemy movements before they happen. Using those visions of the future in battle sounds like it could be very useful. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The Samsung P9 512GB microSD Express Card for Nintendo Switch 2 is on sale for $75 (was $100). This is marked as a limited-time deal, but it's unclear when the price will climb back to $100. If you're looking for a 1TB card, the TeamGroup Apex is on sale for an all-time low of $180 (was $212). Amazon has also restocked the Switch 2 Mario Kart bundle and is matching Walmart's deal price of $449 (was $500). If you pick up the Mario Kart bundle and need a carrying case, Amazon has deals on several officially licensed travel cases, including one that's themed around Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.
