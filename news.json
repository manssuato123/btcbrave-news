    "description": "The list of complaints that players have with the current state of Destiny 2 is lengthy. Whether it be issues with the game's new activities hub--the Portal--an unfulfilling grind for better loot, the implied irrelevance of old gear, the quality of missions that are available, or progress-stalling bugs, the argument for this being the lowest point in Destiny's history is strong--despite some other periods that put up competition for that title. While it's impossible to know how the playerbase at large will holistically receive the content I experienced at a two-day preview of Destiny 2's upcoming Renegades expansion, what I do know is that there is a lot there for the community to engage with, which already feels like a step up from the previous expansion The Edge of Fate. When Renegades launches in December, the first thing players will encounter is its campaign, which is serving double duty. Its first responsibility is as a continuation of The Fate Saga, the multi-expansion story that kicked off with The Edge of Fate. At the end of that release, we learned of a vague prophecy that foretold the end of everything, lest our player Guardians \"bind the Nine;\" a group of primordial, fourth-dimensional beings who pull the strings of Destiny's universe. But what does binding the Nine actually entail? That's the million-glimmer question at the heart of the saga. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Ubisoft has posted a job on Hitmarker for a technical sound designer for Beyond Good and Evil 2. The role calls for the person in question to have the duties of both a sound designer and an audio technical lead with an emphasis on creating audio assets, as well as proposing and integrating audio designs. More intriguingly, the listing reconfirms that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 will be a prequel to the original game that offers \"a seamless experience of exploration and space piracy across a solar system full of exotic locations, colorful characters and mysteries to uncover, solo or with friends.\" That suggests the sequel will have multiplayer capabilities Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Lego Ideas: The Insect Collection (1,111 pieces) $40 (was $80) See at Amazon See at Walmart Amateur entomologists, take note--Lego Ideas: The Insect Collection is down to its lowest price ever for Black Friday. The set hasn't seen many discounts over the years, but right now it's just $40 (was $80) at both Amazon and Walmart. Lego says that this is one of its sets that'll be retired soon, so if you want to add it to your collection, the current deal is hard to pass up. Lego Ideas: The Insect Collection (1,111 pieces) $40 (was $80) This colorful set lets you build three different insects: a blue morpho butterfly, a Hercules beetle, and a Chinese mantis. All three are fully posable and come with a tiny display stand, making it easy to show them off in your home. The beetle might be the coolest of the bunch, however, as it comes with a pair of attachable wings that connect to its thorax, which makes for a pretty eye-catching display. Since each insect comes with its own instruction booklet, you can build these solo or with a few friends. There are also digital instructions on the Lego Builder app if you'd like something more visual. Once completed, the insects are quite sizable. The Hercules beetle alone stands around 7 inches tall and 6.5 inches wide, so make sure you have plenty of space on your table or shelf to show off the trio.

    "title": "How Riftbound Fixes Magic: The Gathering's Biggest Problems",
    "description": "Riot Games recently launched Riftbound, a trading-card game based on the wildly popular League of Legends franchise. While the first thought that comes to mind when coming across a new TCG in an overcrowded market is usually “another one?” I’m here to tell you that not only does Riftbound have a strong foundation for a casual/competitive game, it actually improves and fixes many mechanics seen in other TCGs. Most notably, Riftbound addresses my biggest issues with Magic: The Gathering and its 30-year-old design that at times feels wildly outdated. Here’s a breakdown of just some of the many improvements I noticed while playing Riftbound as a seasoned Magic player. Casual Yet Competitive One of my least favorite aspects of Magic is having to juggle multiple decks for multiple situations. When playing Limited, I have to build a 40-card deck. When playing Pauper or Vintage, I have to maintain 60-card decks. When playing Commander with friends at the local brewery, I have to carry around a 100-card behemoth of a deck. The different formats all carry their own restrictions and decklists and it can be a lot to maintain for a single card game. This issue doesn’t exist for Riftbound, as any 40-card deck you buy or build is good for use in 1v1, 2v2, and three- or four-player Free-for-All. While any TCG can inspire the “grinding” mindset that comes with entering competitive play, I find myself regularly playing casual Riftbound matches simply because the game scales so well without deck modifications. It encourages the mindset of building a single deck and being able to play it in multiple formats, and means my Jinx deck that I’m so proud of can be shown off a lot more. To learn a bit more about this design choice of scalable formats, I talked with Nik Davidson, game design architect over at Riot Games. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "If you've spent any time on X in recent days, you may have seen some gameplay \"leaks\" of Grand Theft Auto 6. They've gone incredibly viral thanks to a poster named Zap Actu GTA6, who's admitted that the videos they've shared are all generated using artificial intelligence. As spotted by IGN, Zap Actu GTA6 began posting these \"leaks\" on November 18. They all typically show some male or female figure walking through Leonida, a fictional state based on Florida. The first video only generated 217 likes and 26,000 views, but subsequent ones gained more traction as Zap Actu GTA6 posted more. In a video posted on November 19 that garnered 6,100 likes and 1.8 million views, Zap Actu GTA6 claimed these were from \"several anonymous accounts\" who filmed the clips \"from inside Rockstar’s studios.\" Another one posted on November 21 purported that a character has \"facial features strongly resembling those of Leonardo DiCaprio.\" Despite claiming there's \"absolutely no official confirmation\" on anything being posted, Zap Actu GTA6 still noted that the leaks are real and serious. That \"leak\" that really blew up was posted on November 25. Zap Actu GTA6 said the video they shared \"surfaced on TikTok before being taken down.\" It allegedly showed a gameplay moment of someone controlling co-protagonist Lucia as she walked along what appeared to be a beach with a \"dynamic weather system\" that produced heavy clouds and rain showers. The video went viral, getting 34,000 likes and 8.1 million views, and it wasn't the only one that got this much attention online. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

All PS Plus members will be able to claim five games starting December 2: Lego Horizon Adventures, Killing Floor 3, The Outlast Trials, Synduality Echo of Ada, and Neon White. If you haven't claimed November's PlayStation Plus free games yet, make sure to do so before next Tuesday, December 2. PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers can also get Skate Story as a day-one download through the Game Catalog, starting December 8. Lego Horizon Adventures is the headliner of this batch, as the Horizon spin-off game launched not too long ago. A lighthearted retelling of the events of Horizon Zero Dawn--but with a Lego spin--the game follows Aly on her quest to uncover the lost history of the world, following a cataclysm that saw machines rise to the top of the food chain. Killing Floor 3 is another recent release, and this multiplayer shooter sees teams of up to six players gear up to take down Zeds in stomach-churning combat. The Outlast Trials is also a grisly co-op game with terrifying elements woven into its design, as you'll need to complete grisly challenges to survive in this first-person psychological survival-horror game.
