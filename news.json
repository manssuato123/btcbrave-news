Kill Bill's The Bride has already been confirmed, and now it looks like Marty McFly from Back to the Future will arrive shortly thereafter. And it seems likely that Marty will be bringing Doc Brown's time-traveling DeLorean with him.

The leak from Shiina doesn't specify if or how the DeLorean will be utilized, but Epic Games is already using the car in Rocket League.

Other reports suggest that the next Fortnite map \"will begin with a distinctive Los Angeles flavor and will have a desert biome.\" Since Epic is spelling out the word \"seven\" for this chapter, it's led to speculation that The Seven--a team of heroes who used to appear in Fortnite--may finally get their comeback.

    "description": "World of Warcraft's upcoming Midnight expansion is bringing sweeping changes to the MMORPG's transmog system, but they look to be far more expensive than players were led to believe. Earlier this year when Midnight was fully revealed, developer Blizzard announced it would be overhauling the game's cosmetic outfit system in a way that would save players gold. Instead of having to pay gold to transmog individual gear pieces, players would instead transmog gear slots. That slot would then retain its appearance regardless of whatever item was equipped, useful as players level up and equip new gear over the course of an expansion or season. Sounds good on paper. However, the system is now testable on the WoW: Midnight beta, and as broken down by Wowhead, players are discovering these supposedly cost-saving changes are actually extremely expensive.

    "description": "Embark Studios has released the patch notes for the latest Arc Raiders update, which details map adjustments, a nerf for the powerful Venator, and ammo changes. It also includes a welcomed surprise for duck collectors. The most notable change in this Arc Raiders update is the nerf to the game's powerful Venator pistol. The developer says it was aware that the fully upgraded Venator was over-performing and \"capable of outgunning full squads using close-range weapons.\" The gun's nerf includes a reduction to the fire rate gained from upgrades, and it also receives an increase in weight. The developer says the weapon's weight was not previously in line with the other pistols in the game, so the weight was increased from 2 to 5. Another major nerf in the update affects the game's powerful Deadline mine. Players have been taking down the game's largest Arc enemies with the Deadline mines, and the developer seems to think it's been too easy to utilize, as the update makes it harder to obtain the mines. The buy value of the Deadline has been increased from 8,100 to 15,000 Coins, the crafting materials needed have also increased, and traders will now carry less stock of the mine.

    "description": "Minor spoilers for Hades and Hades II to follow--read at your own discretion. Since its inception, Supergiant Games has built up a reputation around high-quality story experiences with deep gameplay systems to match. Yet while all the San Francisco-based studio's games are worthy of praise, it was the first Hades game that raised the bar when it came to roguelike games and their storytelling. It only makes sense, then, that it also became the first Supergiant title to earn a sequel. Hades II carries over a lot of the features that made its predecessor such a beloved title, with one exception: its protagonist. This shift presented Supergiant with an exciting opportunity to explore new themes, making it disappointing that the end result instead plays into matronly stereotypes. While the first game had a protagonist who started out a cocky, sarcastic jackass before undergoing a deep and meaningful character arc, Hades II forgoes this in favor of making its female protagonist overtly stoic and duty-bound, playing into the misogynistic societal expectations for female-identifying people.

Amazon has discounted Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot - Daima Edition to $30 (was $50) for the PS5 version, while the massive fighting game Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero has gotten a 50% discount and is available for $30 on both PS5 and Xbox Series X. Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero $30 (was $60) Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero is the most recent video game release in the franchise, and it's an anime-inspired slugfest with a massive roster of characters pulled from every era of Dragon Ball. Everyone from Goku to Vegeta is included in the game's lineup, and while the combat does have a steep learning curve, once you nail it you'll be throwing out Final Flash and Kamehameha attacks like a pro. The game also looks stunning in action, and if you grew up playing the Dragon Ball Budokai Tenkaichi games, then this will appeal to you as it's a continuation of that series. PS5 -- $30 ($60) Xbox Series X -- $30 ($60) See at Amazon See at Best Buy Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot - Daima Edition $30 (was $50) In comparison, Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is an action-RPG that blends fast-paced fisticuffs with level-grinding. The game also gives you a world to explore as you take part in Goku's greatest battles across the Dragon Ball storyline, and since launch, publisher Bandai Namco has expanded on the game with several story DLC drops inspired by classic OVA series and Dragon Ball Super. The Daima Edition does not include those expansions, but it does come bundled with the two-part Daima DLC, which is based on the Dragon Ball Daima anime series. One thing to note here is that only the first part has been released so far, and Part Two will arrive in early 2026.

    "title": "Elden Ring Nightreign Drops To Just $25 For Black Friday",
    "description": "Elden Ring All Elden Ring games have gotten big Black Friday discounts All Elden Ring Black Friday deals at Amazon Out of all the souls-like games on the market, Elden Ring is considered to be the gold standard for the genre. From Software's masterpiece has sold tens of millions of copies since it was first released a few years ago, and if you've been looking to try it out, this Black Friday deal will get you the game for just $20 (was $40). Its award-winning expansion Shadow of the Erdtree and the spin-off game Elden Ring Nightreign have also received big discounts. Elden Ring $20 (was $50) This isn't the first time that Elden Ring has sold for $20, but the game is very rarely discounted to this low price. Similar to From Software's other souls-likes, Elden Ring is an elegantly grim game set in a land of fantasy, wonder, and danger. Game of Thrones author George RR Martin contributed to its lore and world, and everywhere you go, there's always something to discover in The Lands Between. It's only one of a select few games to earn a rare 10/10 score at GameSpot, as it's a game full of substance and style. If you decide to pick it up for PS5 but that version is sold out, the PS4 edition does offer a free PS5 upgrade. Elden Ring PS5 PS4 Xbox Series X See at Amazon See at Best Buy Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Edition $40 - $50 (was $80) Shadow of the Erdtree isn't just a simple expansion for Elden Ring: It's an essential part of the experience and its grand sweeping narrative. While From Software could have done more of the same and simply called it a day, Shadow of the Erdtree adds an increased amount of new weapons, equipment, skills, and magic that are not found in the original game. Amazon is offering the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Edition for $50 on both PS5 and Xbox Series X, which gets you both Elden Ring and the expansion together in a single bundle. This normally costs $80 on its own and is rarely discounted this much, so this is quite the savings. Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Edition PS5 -- $50 Xbox Series X -- $40 See at Amazon See at Best Buy Elden Ring Nightreign $25-$35 Released earlier this year, Elden Ring Nightreign retains the gameplay that made the original game and its expansion so popular, but it reimagines the experience as a co-op boss rush game set in the land of Limveld--an alternate version of Elden Ring's Limgrave. Gameplay revolves around players teaming up and choosing a boss to fight, leveling up during the day for a brutal showdown at night. Expeditions generally last around 35-45 minutes, making for breezy but enjoyable gameplay sessions. You can get either the standard edition or the Amazon-exclusive edition on sale, with Amazon's version offering additional playable characters and bosses, a digital artbook, mini soundtrack, and a poster of the game's key art, all for an extra $10. \"Elden Ring's DNA is ever-present, but Nightreign is also a game of striking subversions: a From Software game that asks you to play it unconventionally, disregarding meticulous exploration, isolation, and measured combat for a cooperative multiplayer game built on speed and aggression. In many ways, it's the antithesis of what people typically come to From Software games for, and yet somehow, someway, this experimental non-sequel is an absolute triumph,\" Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's Elden Ring: Nightreign review.
