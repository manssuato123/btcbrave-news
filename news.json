    "description": "Earlier this year, Silent Hill f became the first game in the series to ditch the small American town that the series was named for in favor of setting it in Japan decades earlier. That approach may be used again for future titles in the franchise, according to developer Motoi Okamoto. \"We believe we could perhaps take similar approaches with other cultures across the globe,\" Okamoto told Inverse through a translator. \"For example, in Central or South America, we could perhaps tap into the more local, shamanistic beliefs and see how that ties in. But we could also try to expand our horizons and look into other regions, like possibly Russia, Italy, or South Korea, because all those areas have their own unique types of belief systems. I believe that will be a gateway for us to expand our concepts further.\" Okamoto appears to have put the most thought into the Central and South American locations, which he said have \"been affected by a lot of military governments and coups,\" before adding, \"There is a type of bravado and 'machismo' that comes from these political landscapes. There’s also the more folkloric angle coming from shamanism and local beliefs.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Activision released a very brief teaser clip for Black Ops 7 and Warzone to reveal the operator skins for this upcoming crossover. While you can't see the full details of the operator skins, the silhouettes clearly hint at operators for Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus in his power armor. Call of Duty's big IP collaborations also usually come packed with events for players to participate in. It's uncertain if the skins will be included in an event pass or as shop bundles for purchase.

    "description": "For three decades, the Tekken series has brought players together as they control of some of the best fighters in the world. Now, a 92-year-old Japanese woman named Hisako Sakai has carved out her own legend in the King of the Iron Ring battles by winning a Tekken 8 tournament. As reported by Automaton, the tournament of senior citizen Tekken 8 players was put on by the Japanese eSports association Care. The mission statement of that organization is to \"create an environment in which the elderly can casually participate in eSports.\" Care has been running tournaments since 2019 while treating them like a major event with livestreaming and official commentators. A video from the event can be seen below. Sakai made it all the way to the finals while playing as Claudio, when she went up against 74-year-old player Goro Sugiyama, who used Lili as his character. The match between Sakai and Sugiyama can be found two hours and 25 minutes into the video above. Despite the advantage of Sugiyama's relative youth, Sakai appears to have a superior button-mashing technique and enough mastery of the game to execute an effective path to victory.

    "description": "The conventional wisdom is that Kinect was an albatross on Xbox One, making the system more expensive at launch and taking away resource power. But now, over a decade later, the Kinect-like Nex Playground has outsold Xbox hardware for November in the US, according to Circana. Nex Playground came in third for hardware units sold last month, outpacing Xbox Series X|S. The only saving grace is that Xbox raked in more dollar sales, as Nex Playground retails for $250 but has been on sale for $200 over the holiday season. Overall, video game hardware sales were pretty bleak, reaching a low not seen since November 1995. Top 10 Best-Selling Video Games Of All Time See More This might not be a total shock for those paying attention. Nex Playground actually outsold every PS5 and Xbox console bundle for a week last month in the US. The cube-shaped console features a camera to track body movements, similar to Kinect. Five games are pre-installed, with the option to purchase a subscription Play Pass for a larger library of games. It's $49 for three months or $89 for a year. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "A leading industry observer has predicted that EA's Battlefield 6 is \"extremely likely\" to outsell Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 in the US to finish as the year's No. 1 best-selling game. Prior to the release of Battlefield 6 in October and Black Ops 7 in November, industry experts predicted that Black Ops 7 would come out on top. But new data has arrived pointing to Black Ops 7's sales struggles, and now Mat Piscatella of Circana has told IGN that EA's game will likely be the best-seller. It would be just the second time since 2018 that a Call of Duty game would be outsold in the US. The last time it happened was 2023, when Hogwarts Legacy beat Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. Before that, Red Dead Redemption II came out on top in 2018, with Black Ops 4 at No. 2. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The battle for Warner Bros. may be down to Netflix and Paramount, but the studio has a clear favorite. Earlier this month, Netflix bid $82.7 billion dollars for Warner Bros., jilting Paramount in the process. Paramount responded with a hostile takeover bid of $108.4 billion. Now, Warner Bros. is urging its shareholders to reject Paramount's \"illusory\" offer. \"Following a careful evaluation of Paramount's recently launched tender offer, the Board concluded that the offer's value is inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on our shareholders,\" reads a letter to shareholders from Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr., the chair of Warner Bros. Discovery's board of directors. Although Paramount's offer is higher, Warner Bros.' contends that Paramount's owners, the Ellison family, didn't offer a \"full backstop\" commitment to provide the money to cover its offer and that it can walk away from the transaction without paying any penalty. By comparison, Netflix and Warner Bros. have a $5 billion breakup fee if their deal fails to close or meet regulatory approval. Warner Bros. also contends that the proposed Paramount deal will not be approved by regulators. Regardless, Netflix isn't guaranteed to be approved either. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Tomb Raider is officially coming to iOS and Android devices on February 12, 2026, and it's priced at $20. This version of the game will also include all 12 DLC packs, adding more outfits, upgrades, and a bonus Challenge Tomb. Feral Interactive says the game has been \"expertly optimized\" for smartphones and tablets and will feature a customizable touchscreen interface. Controller support will also feature in this release, and supported devices will offer gyroscopic motion-aiming. You can preorder it now through the iOS App Store, or you can pre-register for it on the Google Play Store if you're using an Android device. Tomb Raider was a big hit when it arrived more than a decade ago, as it chronicled Lara Croft's first big adventure on the mysterious island of Yamatai. Two sequels followed it, Rise of the Tomb Raider and Shadow of the Tomb Raider. The franchise is also poised for a comeback, as two new games were revealed during The Game Awards.
