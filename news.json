    "description": "For the past two decades, the Call of Duty titles have almost always been the US's top-selling games of the year. But it looks like Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is experiencing a marked decline in sales from its predecessor, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. According to GamesIndustry.biz, Alinea Analytics' data indicates that Black Ops 7 sold 401,000 copies on Steam in the first 26 days after its launch. By comparison, Black Ops 6 sold 2.3 million copies in the same time period in 2024. Call of Duty games have historically sold fewer copies on Steam than on consoles, and Black Ops 6 and 7 were both included with PC Game Pass. But that doesn't account for why the latter had such a dramatic decline. Video Game Insights also shared data that suggests Black Ops 7's daily active users dropped to 18 million in November 2025, down from 36 million DAU in December 2024. Going back to Modern Warfare in 2022, concurrent users on Steam had been on a steady decline from 500,000 in early 2023 before briefly rebounding to over 300,000 players for Black Ops 6. Currently, Black Ops 7 is estimated to have a concurrent count between 50,000 and 100,000 players on Steam. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Ugly Sonic Returns As Fan Edit Will Restore The Infamous Original Design",
    "description": "Five years after the first live-action Sonic the Hedgehog movie was released, fans have almost forgotten how close they came to seeing pure nightmare fuel in that blockbuster movie. The original Sonic design was a strange mix of blue fur and too many teeth, but the redesign of Sonic that followed was far more faithful to the video games. A26, a group of renegade Sonic fans, isn't satisfied with it. They're busy putting Ugly Sonic back into the movie, with a project called Sonic the Hedgehog: The 2019 Cut, and a trailer for it is set to be released on December 24. A26 originally intended to have the trailer out this week, but they weren't satisfied with the result and pushed the date back a few weeks. \"We wanted Sonic’s animation to feel as fluid as possible, and to be honest, it would have gotten some negative reviews if we’d released it today,\" A26 wrote in a social media post. \"We promise it will be totally worth it, paying tribute to the original design as it always should have been.\" A short clip for you all 🫣Hope you like It#GottaFixFast🌀🦔 pic.twitter.com/2ET7vPsZSV — Sonic The Hedgehog: The 2019 Cut (@SonicCut2026) December 11, 2025 To give you an idea of what you can expect, A26 releases a short GIF of Ugly Sonic jogging inside a washing machine. The project is expected to be released online in 2026. While it's going to be a long wait to see the 2019 cut of Sonic the Hedgehog, you can see the infamous character--voiced by I Think You Should Leave's Tim Robinson--save the day in 2022's Chip 'n Dale movie.

    "title": "GTA 6 Clues May Be Hidden In GTA Online's Big New Update, Fans Think",
    "description": "The recent A Safehouse in the Hills update for GTA Online may contain clues about Grand Theft Auto VI, or at least that's what the franchise's passionate fanbase is theorizing based on some recent discoveries. After the big new update went live on December 10, people dug into the game's code in search of anything that might provide clues about GTA 6, and people think they found some. A line of text that was discovered references a voice line for the character Jimmy, the son of main character Michael, that says he is \"moving out of state.\" Another line, from his mother Amanda, says, \"Our son is finally moving away from home.\" People are taking this to suggest that Jimmy may have moved to Leonida, the stand-in for GTA 6's setting of Florida, but that's just conjecture for now. Dataminers also discovered that the KnoWay autonomous driving company that was added to GTA Online in the new update was formerly known as Sahara. That is the name of a delivery and logistics company for GTA 6, as seen in previously released GTA 6 screenshots. The dataminer, Tex2, theorized that Rockstar might have at one point planned a Part 2 for the A Safehouse in the Hills expansion to be timed with GTA 6's previous release date of May 2026 prior to the game's delay to November 2026.

    "description": "Bigfoot isn't a myth. It's real, and it's really wandering around the forests ... in Fortnite, as a new update added the mythical sasquatch to the battle royale shooter. Thanks to a recent 39.10 update that landed on December 11, players noticed something strange in Fortnite's woods. Apparently, Epic Games introduced Bigfoot to the game's sprawling world, but it isn't easy to find. Bigfoot roams the entire map, meaning it could appear by the Fore Fields, near the Humble Hills, and anywhere in between. It's also immune to damage, so shooting it means nothing. And if you get within 35 meters, it vanishes, leaving you on yet another wild sasquatch hunt before getting blasted to death. BIGFOOT WAS ADDED IN TODAY'S UPDATE 😭He walks around the entire map, is immune to damage, and will disappear if you get too close to him(via @FN_Assist) pic.twitter.com/Mdi5GxeSoU — Shiina (@ShiinaBR) December 11, 2025 Contrary to its name, however, Bigfoot isn't that big. As players found it, it actually appears rather little. The perspective could be off, but based on screenshots circulating on X, Bigfoot looks no bigger than a budding flower. Maybe it should be known as \"Littlefoot,\" then. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
