    "title": "The Classic Pink Panther Films Are Coming To 4K Blu-ray Nex Week",
    "description": "The Pink Panther Blu-rays Releasing December 30 See at Amazon The Pink Panther is one of the few film franchises instantly recognizable by its theme tune, and if you've never seen it, you can grab four classic entries in the series on 4K Blu-ray starting December 30. Each new release includes a standard Blu-ray disc of the movie and special features. Preorders are available now, and each one is discounted to $31.49 (was $45) at Amazon. Here's a look at all four of the upcoming Pink Panther 4K Blu-rays, along with links to preorder if you're interested. The Pink Panther (1963) (4K) $31.49 (was $45) | Releases December 30 The Pink Panther film series began with the original film in 1963, introducing the world to the blundering French police inspector Jacques Clouseau, played by Peter Sellers. Facing off against the dashing European thief Sir Charles Lytton (David Niven), Clouseau had to match what few wits he had against the master criminal and prevent him from stealing the titular Pink Panther diamond. This new 4K Blu-ray release is the first time the film has been available in 4K. Preorders are discounted to $31.49 (was $45) at Amazon. Preorder at Amazon A Shot in the Dark (4K) $31.49 (was $45) | Releases December 30 The next film in the series, A Shot in the Dark, hit theaters in 1964 and sees Sellers return as Inspector Clouseau. This was a standalone sequel to The Pink Panther, and it introduced Clouseau's boss, Commissioner Dreyfus, who was the frequent victim of the inspector's near-lethal clumsiness. Just like The Pink Panther, this new A Shot in the Dark 4K Blu-ray launches on December 30, and Amazon is marking down preorders to $31.49 (was $45). Preorder at Amazon The Pink Panther Strikes Again (4K) $31.49 (was $45) | Releases December 30 Sellers reunited with director Blake Edwards and several familiar faces for Return of the Pink Panther in 1975--though, strangely, that film's 4K Blu-ray version is planned to launch later in 2026 and it not available to preorder. However, its 1976 follow-up, The Pink Panther Strikes Again, is getting a 4K Blu-ray on the same day as the others. This entry follows the now-deranged Commissioner Dreyfus from the previous films and his schemes to murder Clouseau. Preorder at Amazon Revenge of the Pink Panther (4K) $31.49 (was $45) | Releases December 30 The final Pink Panther 4K Blu-ray launching on December 30 is 1978's Revenge of the Pink Panther. This film closes out Sellers' run as Clouseau, and sees the detective take on French drug kingpin Philippe Douvier. Just like the other releases, preorders are discounted to $31.49 (was $45) at Amazon. Preorder at Amazon While this covers most of the mainline films starring Peter Sellers as Inspector Jacques Clouseau, the third film in the series, Return of the Pink Panther, is expected to be released on 4K Blu-ray later in 2026.

    "title": "Return To Pandora With These Avatar Collector's Editions 4K Blu-Rays",
    "description": "Avatar Blu-rays Collector's Edition, 4K, and 3D Blu-rays See at Amazon See at Walmart Avatar: The Way of Water Collector's Edition (4K) $76 See at Amazon See at Walmart With Avatar: Fire and Ash now in theaters, it's a great time to catch up on the previous two films in director James Cameron's blockbuster sci-fi series. Luckily, new stock of the Avatar and Avatar: The Way of Water Collector's Edition 4K Blu-rays have arrived at Amazon and Walmart. These are the most comprehensive versions of the films available so far, offering both 4K and Blu-ray versions of the movies on disc alongside a bunch of special features, some of which are exclusive to these Collector's Editions. We've outlined the details for both Collector's Editions below. However, if you're looking to save some cash, we've also thrown in links to the standard edition 4K Blu-rays and 3D Blu-ray releases for Avatar and Avatar: The Way of Water as well. Avatar Collector's Edition (4K) $47.73 Avatar's Collector's Edition is loaded with extra content across this four-disc set. The box set includes theatrical, special edition, and extended cuts of Avatar in 4K, as well as standard Blu-ray and a digital streaming copy of the film. What makes this edition special is that it includes hours of exclusive special features, ranging from deleted scenes to an in-depth deconstruction of how several major moments from the movie were created and filmed. Additionally, there's a behind-the-scenes presentation by famed filmmaker Jon Landau, RDA promos featuring Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch, and several featurettes examining the script, artwork, and marketing of Avatar. Considering that the film employed several groundbreaking visual and special effects technologies throughout its production, the deep dives into how Avatar was made make for a lengthy and informative look behind the curtain. See at Amazon See at Walmart Avatar Standard Edition (4K) $27 While the 4K version of Avatar isn't as extensive as the Collector's Edition in terms of special features or different cuts of the film, it's still a solid option. The three-disc set includes three hours of bonus materials and the upscaled edits from the 2022 theatrical remaster minus the extended additional scenes from previous releases. See at Walmart Avatar 3D Blu-ray $34.49 (was $56) If you have a 3D TV, you can also get the 3D version of Avatar. The movie raised the bar for 3D films and remains the gold standard for the format. The 3D version uses the theatrical cut of Avatar. It also includes a standard (non-3D) Blu-ray and digital copy of the film, along with the same selection of bonus materials as the standard 4K version. See at Amazon Avatar: The Way of Water Collector's Edition (4K) $76 Like the Avatar: Collector's Edition, this version of the film sequel is packed with extras. In total, there are over eight hours of bonus materials across four discs that thoroughly explore the making of the movie through several featurettes, while also expanding on its story with several deleted and extended scenes. All the discs are housed inside of a fold-out case featuring unique artwork from the movie, and it supports Dolby Vision. See at Amazon See at Walmart Avatar: The Way of Water Standard Edition (4K) $22.49 If you want to save a few dollars and don't mind missing out on the Collector's Edition's exclusive extras, Avatar: The Way of Water is also available in a standard edition 4K Blu-ray release for just $22.49. While the list of special features is shorter, you're still getting a 4K quality version of the film on disc. And if you really want to save, there's even a DVD version of Avatar: The Way of Water available for $10, but this is strictly a movie-only release with no extra content, and it's in much lower visual quality than the 4K or even 3D Blu-ray versions. See at Amazon (4K) See at Amazon (DVD) Avatar: The Way of Water 3d (Blu-ray) $31.36 Fans of 3D movies can also pick up the film in this enhanced version, but it's worth noting that it has a smaller selection of special features than the standard and Collector's Edition 4K Blu-rays. It still totals over three hours of extra content with a curated list of featurettes, behind-the-scenes documentaries, and more, plus you're getting a standard Blu-ray and digital copy of the film to watch. See at Amazon Directed by James Cameron (Terminator 2, Alien, Titanic), the Avatar series takes place in the 22nd Century on the faraway alien planet of Pandora, where the native Na'vi species clash with high-tech human colonizers who pillage the world for its valuable resources. The saga follows Jake Sully, a human whose mind is transferred into a genetically engineered Na'vi body on a mission to infiltrate and sabotage their resistance. However, Sully quickly finds himself won over by the Na'vi, and joins their side to push back the invading human forces. The first two films in the series, Avatar and Avatar: The Way of Water are some of the most successful movies in recent history. The two films combined have grossed over $5.2 billion at the box office, and the third film, Avatar: Fire and Ash, premiered on December 19 to positive reviews and an equally strong $345 million global box office opening weekend. Cameron plans to wrap up the saga with two more Avatar films, with Avatar 4 tentatively planned for December 2029, followed by the fifth and final movie in December 2031.

Speaking to Edge, studio boss Guillaume Broche said he does not feel tempted to grow the company in the wake of the success of Expedition 33, which was the studio's debut title. Why not? He said (via GI.biz), \"I think it's good to have limitations when you are creative.\" \"It's the best way to be the best version of yourself. We could scale up now we have a lot more money, but I would say it's not tempting for us, because even the management team and myself, we'd have to be hands-on and doing things for ourselves,\" he said. \"We love making games more than we love managing, so we want to keep doing that.
