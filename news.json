To be eligible for The Game Awards this year, games must be \"available for public consumption\" on or before Friday, November 21. Any game releases after then will be eligible for next year's show. This also means that games released on or after November 22, 2024 are eligible for this year's event. Live-service games that released in a previous year are eligible for all categories, provided the voting jury determines that \"their inclusion is merited due to new content, improvements, or service updates.\" There is also a dedicated category, Best Ongoing Game, which recognizes such titles.

    "title": "How Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined Fixes The Original's \"Painful\" Slog",
    "description": "Dragon Quest is one of the most recognizable names in classic RPGs, and also one that has recently leaned heavily on the past to attract new fans. Square Enix has remastered the first three classic DQ games, dubbed the Erdrick Trilogy, and is now skipping ahead to the seventh installment with Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined. It's an unexpected move, but partially explained by DQ7 having such a notorious reputation among fans. Namely, it was a slog. Even its own key developers acknowledge that much, which made it ripe for a remake that trims the fat. I played a little over an hour of Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined and talked with producer Takeshi Ichikawa. My limited time was not enough to get a feel for the full scope of the cuts, but I was impressed by the other ways it's being modernized. It starts with the art style, which is immediately striking. Square Enix noted during a presentation that to establish the revised look, it constructed physical dolls for each of the major party members, giving them the ability to focus on small details like the texture of their clothing. Those dolls were then scanned in to act as digital puppets, and the rest of the game was developed to match their style. That gives it a handcrafted look that is, I dare say, cozy. The perspective is still primarily following your characters from above, as you'd expect in a classic RPG, but the character detail is readily apparent even there, and you get a closer look at them in cutscenes and battles. Ichikawa said that the doll-like art style was an homage to the late Akira Toriyama, the renowned manga artist who also created the visual style for all of the Dragon Quest games before his passing in 2024. When Toriyama designed the characters for DQ7, they were given a more \"cutesy, adorable aesthetic\" compared to other Dragon Quest games, with more squat designs that differed from his usual art. The company researched ways to maintain and update that visual style and found inspiration in other media, like movies and TV shows, that have used a doll motif. That inspired the creation of physical dolls to define the look, which he says helped create realistic fabrics and textures that influenced the overall style. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Developer Sucker Punch Productions has revealed a new patch for the open-world samurai sim Ghost of Yotei that introduces a New Game Plus mode on November 24, which lets you literally bring a gun to a swordfight ... or at least more of them. The studio posted a video to the official PlayStation YouTube channel showcasing Ghost of Yotei's New Game Plus update as part of the upcoming free patch 1.100.000. The mode does exactly what you'd expect: allows you to replay the entirety of Atsu's revenge tale with all of the gear and skills you've already unlocked, giving you an edge--or a bullet--on the battlefield, which means you don't have to unlock the two different guns again. You'll start Atsu's journey already strapped. You can also replay challenges with stat tracking to set scores for certain duels, experience harder difficulty options in the settings menu, and purchase new gear (like charms, dyes, and cosmetics) from a new merchant.

Minecraft Blast is a free-to-play mobile game that combines match puzzles with a Minecraft-themed world that you can continually upgrade. Mojang and King describe it as a \"delightfully blocky puzzle adventure,\" and promise \"fun and challenging\" match puzzles that grant rewards that can be used to build structures and items. From the screenshots and footage we've seen so far, it looks like you'll have to clear blocks--some of which may be familiar to existing Minecraft players, such as TNT--which then grants energy or currency that can be used to purchase structures or items to place in your world.

One player had assembled what seemed to be an unstoppable, legendary machine--a combination of three difficult-to-collect pieces that granted a huge advantage. The other player gambled, taking a risky move in striking the machine and destroying it before the match ended. Against all odds, the underdog seized the win. It was a comeback rarely seen in the tight knit Kirby Air Ride community that's been riding Warp Stars for more than five years. This wasn’t just a match--it was a demonstration of the skill, strategy, and intuition that fuels the Kirby Air Ride community. Now, with Kirby Air Riders on the horizon, that community is buzzing louder than ever. The promise of a new official release has fans analyzing trailers and previews, debating which abilities will dominate, and counting down the days until they can prove themselves within the City Trial. \"There was no easy way to play Kirby Air Ride competitively before 2017. Kirby Air Ride wasn't seen as viable,\" Kirby Air Ride caster Betokirby tells GameSpot. \"Then you see UnclePunch working with others to make the HackPack. The HackPack is where competitive Kirby Air Ride started.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "There's A Free New Fortnite Skin You Probably Can't Get",
    "description": "Usually, Fortnite players like it when Epic Games offers a free skin. But that's not the case for Freediver, a new skin that's available for free only through the Priority app, which offers various deals and rewards to customers of UK mobile providers O2 and Virgin Media. O2 and Virgin members can use the Priority app to claim a code that'll let them unlock the skin by gaining a couple account levels. O2 and Virgin Media customers in the UK can unlock the Freediver skin for free in the Priority app. Having a skin locked to specific regional mobile providers means that most of the people in the world cannot get this skin. Not that they'd probably notice, since it's a fairly basic and not particularly interesting skin. But for folks who seriously collect Fortnite skins, that scarcity is a large part of its appeal--having this skin hypothetically offers a little bit of metaverse cred, since it's not something everyone can even get. We'll probably be seeing more of this, however, because this is the second time this year Epic has done this exact thing. Back in August, Epic offered a purple version of this same skin--dubbed Thrilldiver--only to users of the Brazilian telecom company Vivo. It's likely that this free skin is part of Epic's renewed push for mobile players, and that more recolors of this skin will be offered to other groups of mobile customers.
