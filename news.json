    "description": "Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is out this week, ending an 18-year hiatus between this game and the release of Metroid Prime 3: Corruption in 2007. Samus Aran picks up a few new tricks in this sequel, including her new bike, the Vi-O-La. But if you want to hear some optional ambient music while Samus cruises the deserts of planet Viewros, it's going to cost you $30 or the price of a Samus Aran Amiibo. Players have discovered that plugging in the Samus Amiibo enables Vi-O-La Radio, which enables players to choose the music that accompanies Samus's extended journey across the Sol Valley desert on the Vi-O-La. There is already some ambient music and noise to go with those scenes, this just allows players to choose music tracks from other areas to listen to. Finishing the game will also unlock two additional tracks for Vi-O-La Radio. The regular ambient music of Sol Valley doesn't make it a bad experience, and it seems to be evoking something thematically about the planet's history. The music may not be necessary, but some fans may resent having to pay for an option that could have just as easily been included in the base game. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "You'd be forgiven for losing track of how many survival games have come out in the last decade or so, and though I personally enjoy many of them myself, it's exciting to see a new one come along and dramatically overhaul what a survival game looks like, mechanically speaking. In a crowded genre, Hello Sunshine stands out. Yes, it's a survival game with many of the mechanics you'd expect, but it doesn't look quite like any others, thanks to its one (literally) huge twist. That twist is the gigantic robot companion you have by your side. The building-sized automaton walks almost ceaselessly toward a destination, and it's your mission to use its shadow to stay safe from the scorching sun, while strategically dashing into landmarks to quickly loot supplies, all while you dodge other, smaller bots along the way. Hello Sunshine is set in a post-apocalyptic world full of antagonistic robots, and if you're to survive, you'll need to scavenge food, water, and materials to build tools and weapons--all while avoiding the unforgiving rays of the sun. But rather than settle down and build a base for yourself and your robo-pal, you're almost always on the move. It's a much more nomadic experience than, say, Valheim or Minecraft.

    "description": "In 2020, Just Cause creator and Avalanche Studios founder Christofer Sundberg started a new company, Liquid Swords, alongside other industry veterans. Now, the team at Liquid Swords has shared the first trailer for its debut action title, Samson: A Tyndalston Story. It may remind some fans of Grand Theft Auto, but there are differences that make it a lot harder to earn money in this game. Tyndalston is the name of the city, and players will step into the role of Samson McCray, an aging criminal who is facing a crushing debt. Players can steal the money they need, but this isn't like other open-world crime games where you can keep going non-stop. Samson has physical limits as to what he can pull off in a day, which are measured by action points. Use too many on a single job and you won't be able to do much else. As time passes in this world, your debt increases. For every crime you commit, the city remembers and your reputation grows. According to Liquid Swords, \"There are no do-overs. You move forward because standing still makes everything worse.\" This is a story about debt, consequences, and survival. Samson will have to deal with all three on a daily basis.

If you're looking for a deal, Sony recently discounted its Fortnite PS5 bundles by $50 for a limited time. There are two options available, including a Fortnite-themed PS5 console bundled with limited-edition Fortnite DLC for $450 (was $500), and a similar package that includes the PS5 Digital Edition and Fortnite DLC for $400 (was $450). These bundle deals are part of Sony's official Black Friday PlayStation deals, and will be available until December 24. PS5 Fortnite Flowering Chaos Console Bundle $450 (was $500) This PS5 bundle includes a 1TB version of the console with a disc drive, allowing you to both install games from a disc and watch Blu-rays--both 4K UHD and standard--on the machine. The bundled Fortnite DLC includes the following cosmetics and finishers: Florin outfit (Lego style included) Blossom Backpack Back Bling Floral Finisher pickaxe Blue Blossom's Wrap Petal's Edge Guitar Blue Bloom Mic Petal Steppers Kicks 1,000 V-Bucks (in-game currency) Additionally, the PS5 console comes with a DualSense controller.

See at Amazon See at PS Direct See at Walmart PS5 Digital Edition Fortnite Flowering Chaos Console Bundle $400 (was $500) The PS5 Digital Edition console doesn't come with a disc drive, but the PS5 Disc Drive is sold as an optional accessory for this console model and the PS5 Pro. This version of the console also has a smaller SSD--825GB compared to the 1TB in the version above--but that still provides more than enough space to install Fortnite and several other games on it. You'll get the same Fortnite DLC with this console bundle and a single DualSense controller. See at Amazon See at PS Direct See at Walmart Other PS5 consoles are also on sale in PlayStation's Black Friday event, including the limited-edition Ghost of Yotei PS5 Slim bundle.
