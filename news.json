    "description": "Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's new version of Nuketown arrived on November 20, and one of the first things people tried on it was shooting off all the mannequin heads to unlock the long-running Nuketown Easter egg. Unfortunately, it doesn't work in Black Ops 7, at least not yet. This isn't a huge shock, though, as Black Ops 6's version of Nuketown didn't unlock the Easter egg right away, either. A popular video from the Detonated account shows that the mannequin heads on Nuketown 2025 cannot be shot off, thereby not allowing the Easter egg to unlock once they're all blasted away. People are theorizing that the new version of Nuketown does indeed carry forward the Easter egg that's been in every version of Nuketown since 2010, but it's just not active yet. You CANNOT Shoot the 'Mannequin Heads' on Nuketown 2025 in #BlackOps7 🤔The Map is also not available in Private Matches currently. pic.twitter.com/0oSVoltFVj — DETONATED (@DETONATEDcom) November 20, 2025 In Black Ops 6, zombified mannequins sprung forth from the ground for the Easter egg. And as ScreenRant reminds us, when Black Ops 6's version of Nuketown launched, it also didn't have the Easter egg unlocked, but it arrived around a week later. If the same pattern holds for Black Ops 7, fans can expect the latest version of the Easter egg to be here soon. Season 1 is expected to launch in early December, and this could be when the Easter egg gets unlocked for Black Ops 7, but that's just a guess. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "The Stranger Things Kids Are Coming To Fortnite With A Few Major Exceptions",
    "description": "Six years ago, Fortnite introduced Stranger Things' Eleven, Sheriff Hopper and even portals to the Upside Down into the game. With the fifth and final season starting on Netflix next week, Stranger Things is returning to Fornite with a new set of heroes crossing over. Epic Games has revealed that Stranger Things' Mike, Dustin, Will, and Lucas are coming to Fortnite's Blitz Royale mode. Max, Steve, Nancy, Jonathan, and Robin apparently didn't make the cut. The artwork below features the Stranger Things kids--or perhaps young adults is more accurate now--with a backdrop revealing portals to the Upside Down across Hawkins and appearance by Vecna, the show's primary villain. The Stranger Things kids will get their own Fortnite skins very soon.At least some of those Upside Down designs will be a part of the Stranger Things Fortnite Blitz Royale map and the Stranger Things skins will be released through the Fortnite store today. The older Stranger Things skins--Eleven, Jim Hopper, and a Demorgon--aren't currently available, but they seem like strong candidates to return. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "CoD: Black Ops 7 Patch Notes Detail Aim-Assist Change, Drone Pod Nerf, And SMG Buffs",
    "description": "Treyarch has rolled out a new update for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and the patch notes detail plenty of the changes discussed in the studio's recent Dev Talk video. This includes a buff for guns in the submachine class, a nerf for the powerful Drone Pod field upgrade, and adjustments to Black Ops 7's controversial aim-assist. There's been plenty of community debate around Black Ops 7's aim-assist, which features greatly reduced rotational aim-assist compared to recent Call of Duty games. Black Ops 7 launched with a new right-stick aiming requirement for achieving maximum rotational aim-assist strength, meaning that when the right-stick isn't used or isn't tracking a target effectively, players experience minimal rotational aim-assist strength. This minimum aim-assist is a 35% reduction from what players experienced in the beta. In the patch notes, Treyarch says the studio \"slightly overshot\" its target balance, and a small tuning change is made to reduce this aim-assist penalty from 35% to 25%.

    "title": "Which Starter Weapon Should You Choose In Moonlighter 2",
    "description": "Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault asks you to choose from four weapon options at the start of a new game. These are just the base versions of the four weapon types, but you'll be using whichever weapon you pick for several runs before you can unlock another one, making this choice one you'll want to think about. In this guide, we'll break down which weapon is best in Moonlighter 2, so you aren't stuck with the wrong one for a good while. Merchant's Sword The sword is considered a balanced weapon, offering a four-hit attack-pattern for its primary attack, with the final hit functioning as a finisher. The special move is a spinning attack, dealing damage in a circle around Will. If you use your special after three attacks, it transforms into a more powerful finisher. Merchant's Large Sword The Large Sword has a slow attack pattern, but it also has the strongest attacks. The primary attack has a three-hit pattern and uses sharpness on every attack. Your special is a quick jab attack that is much weaker but restores sharpness. The Sharpness meter is broken up by chunks, and for each missing chunk, you deal less damage.

    "title": "How To Expand Your Inventory In Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault",
    "description": "How many relics you can carry back to town is incredibly important in Moonlighter 2, the roguelike shop management game. The more relics you can bring back with you, the more items you have to sell in the shop, which means more money in your pockets. Before you can upgrade your inventory, you'll need to meet an NPC during a run. How to expand your inventory space in Moonlighter 2 To expand your inventory space, you will need to purchase additional slots from Sliver, an NPC who will come to town in the western section. You can meet Sliver fairly early into Moonlighter 2, but there is one requirement to get him to come to town. You need to first encounter Sliver during a run in Kalina. This isn't too difficult, as Kalina is the first area you have access to. All you need to do is find Sliver at a \"?\" room during a run. It's not guaranteed to be him, but there are only a handful of possible characters who can appear. You can unlock additional inventory slots, allowing you to carry even more relics.Once you've encountered him during a run, he will be present in town, where you can purchase inventory slots. The first slot costs 4,000 gold, with the second costing 8,000, increasing from there. There is also another row that becomes available after the first, but that requires crafting materials not currently present in the early access version at the time of writing. While you're at it, you'll also want to be sure to get more potions in Moonlighter 2.",

    "title": "How To Get More Potions In Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault",
    "description": "Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault is all about going on long roguelite runs to bring relics back to town to sell. One of the best ways to extend your runs is to get more potion uses, which can be unlocked by speaking with an NPC in town. You can have up to five total potions, along with other potions-related upgrades, like improved healing. Here's how to unlock more potions in Moonlighter 2. How to get more potions in Moonlighter 2 You can unlock up to five total potion uses for a single dungeon run.Potion upgrades can be purchased from Eris the witch, who is found next door to your shop, just to the south. Eris' upgrades are divided into four sections, unlocked through various means. The first one is available immediately, with the second awarded for reaching the 50,000 coin milestone with the Endless Vault. Once you have a panel unlocked, you need to spend both coins and various crafting materials, dropped by enemies in dungeons. The materials vary depending on the upgrades, although you typically unlock the area with the enemies you need to defeat before unlocking the new panel. Eris also offers other important potion upgrades, like increased healing and pedestals that restore potions during a dungeon. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remake May Reportedly Launch Sooner Than You Think",
    "description": "A new report has claimed that the supposed Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag remake will launch before March 31, 2026. According to an Insider Gaming story (corroborated by Eurogamer), the information came to light after Ubisoft's earnings report was finally released. The report--which the company delayed at the last minute so it could \"finalize the closing of the semester,\" per CFO Frederick Duguet--mentioned that one \"unannounced game\" will come out before the end of Ubisoft's fiscal year ending on March 31, 2026. Insider Gaming claims this blanked-out game in the report is the Black Flag remake and that it will release during the week of March 23. Ubisoft hasn't commented on the report, nor has the company publicly announced anything yet, but there has been a lot of information about the game circulating since its apparent early leaks in June 2023. A Pure Arts livestream from March 2025 may have confirmed its existence, Edward Kenway voice actor Matt Ryan hinted at the game in June 2025, and whenever it does drop, it apparently won't feature modern-day sections but will include additional story content. The rumor mill is a-turning, and if accurate, it's only a matter of time before Ubisoft officially announces the game. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
