Following the less-than-stellar response to Black Ops 7, the franchise will no longer get back-to-back entries in the same sub-series. This applies not only to Black Ops, but also to Modern Warfare. \"We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games,\" Activision said in the official announcement. \"The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year.\" Alongside this announcement, Activision promised \"meaningful, not incremental\" innovation for the series' future. It didn't specify exactly what this would mean, instead stressing it would share more \"when the time is right.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Last week, Netflix put forth an $82 million deal to purchase Warner Bros. Studios, one of the biggest movie and TV studios in the world. Warner Bros. also has a considerable place in the video game industry with franchises like Batman, Harry Potter, and Mortal Kombat under its domain. However, one Netflix executive has now acknowledged that Warner Bros.' gaming division wasn't a significant factor in considering its bid. During a Netflix conference call about the potential WB sale, co-CEO Gregory K. Peters expressed some eagerness to exploit the video game franchises under Warner Bros. in the future. But he added that the games were \"relatively minor\" in the company's initial plans and that it may be \"worth going back again to sort of how we thought about the deal and building our valuation model.\" \"While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space, we actually didn’t attribute any value to that from the get-go because they're relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things,\" continued Peters. \"Now we are super excited because some of those properties that they've built--[Hogwarts Legacy] is a great example of that--have been done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we're offering. They've got great studios and great folks working there. So we think that there's definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven't built that into our deal model.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Nor is it making a toilet simulator game. Publishing boss Michael Douse cleared things up on social media, posting, \"There aren't currently any plans for a new Divinity: Original Sin 3 game but once we are ready to show what we've been working on we will.\" What Larian is making next after the huge success of Baldur's Gate 3 is a mystery, but the studio has said it has multiple projects in various stages of development. One project Larian fans won't get, at least not soon, however, is a game about toilets. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The Game Awards host and organizer Geoff Keighley has opened up on the challenges of running a show that aims to celebrate games and the people who make them while also acknowledging the challenging times people in the industry today are facing. So far in 2025, numerous developers lost their jobs, Microsoft canceled games, and the industry further consolidated with EA announcing plans to sell itself to Saudi Arabia. Speaking to The Game Business, Keighley said the introduction of the Game Changer award in 2024 was an initial attempt to address this. Amir Satvat was given the prize for his work to support people who were laid off in the gaming industry. Keighley hasn't said if this award is coming back in 2025, but it would be a glaring omission if it did not. In any event, Keighley said walking the line between celebrating games and acknowledging current circumstances is no easy task. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

With the year coming to a close, Sony has published a video highlighting some of the \"must-play\" titles coming to PS5 in 2026, and Halo got a special shoutout in the video, while GTA 6 was not mentioned. Seeing Halo promoted so heavily by Sony would have been unthinkable not long ago, and the comments on the video reflect this. The top comment on the video states, \"Seeing Halo here is still surreal.\" Someone else said, \"It feels so weird seeing Halo being advertised by PlayStation.\" Others have pointed out that Rockstar's GTA 6 is not mentioned in the video, with people taking this to mean, or suggest, that Sony is concerned that Rockstar could push the game to 2027. But there could be any number of reasons why GTA 6 was left out. Rockstar, after all, is highly protective of its own game assets. To be sure, it is a giant leap to say that GTA 6 not being featured in video means the game won't make it out on time in 2026. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Arc Raiders has been the talk of the town in the multiplayer arena over the past two months, landing a nomination for Best Multiplayer Game at The Game Awards and becoming one of the most played games in recent weeks. As players prep for this month's upcoming Expedition--an optional wipe that resets much of their progress in exchange for in-game rewards--they'll also be treated to the fresh Cold Snap update. This new content includes an additional snow-based map condition, a premium Raider Deck, and another event to complete for goodies. Here's everything we know about it so far. Table of Contents [hide]Cold Snap release date Cold Snap release date Arc Raiders' Cold Snap update will release on December 16, 2025. While we don't know an exact launch time for this update yet, the previous North Line update launched at 1:30 AM PT / 4:30 AM ET, so it's safe to assume this one may also launch in the wee hours of the morning for US-based players. The Cold Snap update falls just one day before the Expedition window opens, which will allow players to send their raider off and reset much of their in-game progress any time before December 22. This should give dedicated players at least a few days to see this fresh content on their current raider before sending them off and starting anew. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
