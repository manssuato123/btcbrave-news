But now, over a decade later, the Kinect-like Nex Playground has outsold Xbox hardware for November in the US, according to Circana.

The only saving grace is that Xbox raked in more dollar sales, as Nex Playground retails for $250 but has been on sale for $200 over the holiday season. Overall, video game hardware sales were pretty bleak, reaching a low not seen since November 1995. Top 10 Best-Selling Video Games Of All Time See More This might not be a total shock for those paying attention. Nex Playground actually outsold every PS5 and Xbox console bundle for a week last month in the US. The cube-shaped console features a camera to track body movements, similar to Kinect. Five games are pre-installed, with the option to purchase a subscription Play Pass for a larger library of games. It's $49 for three months or $89 for a year. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Battlefield 6 \"Extremely Likely\" To Outsell Black Ops 7 In The US This Year, Expert Says",
    "description": "A leading industry observer has predicted that EA's Battlefield 6 is \"extremely likely\" to outsell Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 in the US to finish as the year's No. 1 best-selling game. Prior to the release of Battlefield 6 in October and Black Ops 7 in November, industry experts predicted that Black Ops 7 would come out on top. But new data has arrived pointing to Black Ops 7's sales struggles, and now Mat Piscatella of Circana has told IGN that EA's game will likely be the best-seller. It would be just the second time since 2018 that a Call of Duty game would be outsold in the US. The last time it happened was 2023, when Hogwarts Legacy beat Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. Before that, Red Dead Redemption II came out on top in 2018, with Black Ops 4 at No. 2. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The battle for Warner Bros. may be down to Netflix and Paramount, but the studio has a clear favorite. Earlier this month, Netflix bid $82.7 billion dollars for Warner Bros., jilting Paramount in the process. Paramount responded with a hostile takeover bid of $108.4 billion. Now, Warner Bros. is urging its shareholders to reject Paramount's \"illusory\" offer. \"Following a careful evaluation of Paramount's recently launched tender offer, the Board concluded that the offer's value is inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on our shareholders,\" reads a letter to shareholders from Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr., the chair of Warner Bros. Discovery's board of directors. Although Paramount's offer is higher, Warner Bros.' contends that Paramount's owners, the Ellison family, didn't offer a \"full backstop\" commitment to provide the money to cover its offer and that it can walk away from the transaction without paying any penalty. By comparison, Netflix and Warner Bros. have a $5 billion breakup fee if their deal fails to close or meet regulatory approval. Warner Bros. also contends that the proposed Paramount deal will not be approved by regulators. Regardless, Netflix isn't guaranteed to be approved either. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Tomb Raider is officially coming to iOS and Android devices on February 12, 2026, and it's priced at $20. This version of the game will also include all 12 DLC packs, adding more outfits, upgrades, and a bonus Challenge Tomb. Feral Interactive says the game has been \"expertly optimized\" for smartphones and tablets and will feature a customizable touchscreen interface. Controller support will also feature in this release, and supported devices will offer gyroscopic motion-aiming. You can preorder it now through the iOS App Store, or you can pre-register for it on the Google Play Store if you're using an Android device. Tomb Raider was a big hit when it arrived more than a decade ago, as it chronicled Lara Croft's first big adventure on the mysterious island of Yamatai. Two sequels followed it, Rise of the Tomb Raider and Shadow of the Tomb Raider. The franchise is also poised for a comeback, as two new games were revealed during The Game Awards.

That's because the Nintendo storefront for Australia has listings up for the episodic game, revealing that the title is planned to launch January 29 on both Nintendo systems. There hasn't been an official announcement from Dispatch developer AdHoc Studio yet about Switch and Switch 2 ports. However, the official Nintendo eShop pages point to this being a matter of when, instead of if, Dispatch arrives on the hybrid consoles. So far, Dispatch is only available on PC and PS5. The Nintendo store listings note that there will be a free Switch 2 upgrade for Dispatch. That edition of the game sports \"enhanced resolution and improved frame rates\" and will take up an estimated 14.6GB of storage space. The listed price is $43.95 AUD--with a launch discount--but keep in mind Australian prices are usually higher than in the US. For example, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on Switch 2 is $109.95 AUD. In comparison, Dispatch costs $30 on Steam and PS5. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "For years, EA Sports was the one-stop shop for FIFA-branded soccer, but that partnership officially ended in 2023. Since then, FIFA has been absent from the video game scene, but today Netflix Games and Delphi Interactive have announced that they will be bringing officially branded FIFA soccer back in a new game slated to launch in 2026. The unnamed FIFA soccer game will be available via the Netflix app on both iOS and Android devices, and it is planned to launch \"this summer,\" just in time for the FIFA World Cup 2026. The official announcement calls the new game a \"newly reimagined FIFA football simulation game,\" but no other details were provided. FIFA and Netflix Games\"This major collaboration is a key milestone in FIFA’s commitment to innovation in the football gaming space, which aspires to reach billions of football fans of all ages everywhere in the world and will be redefining the pure notion of simulation games,\" FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in the offical announcement. \"Our reimagined game truly marks the beginning of a new era of digital football.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

For his part, Straley said \"NPCs are AI\" and have been for decades already in gaming. Straley's new game, Coven of the Chickenfoot, has players taking on the role of Gertie, an elderly witch who works alongside a \"creature companion\" who can \"observe, learn, and evelopment new behaviors based on contextual situations.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Hardware sales had a particularly difficult month, with sales falling 27%, from $949 million in November 2024 to $695 million in November 2025. November 2025 represented the lowest hardware spending total for a November month since November 2005 ($455 million). A total of 1.6 million game hardware units were sold in North America for November 2025, and that's the lowest since November 1995 (1.4 million units). While total unit sales dropped, the average price paid for a new game console reached a new record high for a November month, rising to $439, up 11% compared to November 2024. The higher average selling price is connected to the price increases that companies like Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, and others have implemented this year due to tariffs and other factors.
