While accepting his wins, the game's leading boss Ryozo Tsujimoto shared his conviction that Monster Hunter is still popular among players and he doesn't see any need for the franchise to stop. \"Of course, we don’t intend to stop the series here,\" Tsujimoto told IGN. \"We plan to continue, and we want to let more people play. In addition, I would like to think about things beyond the games so that we can further expand the potential of the Monster Hunter IPs.'\" There was a live-action Monster Hunter movie in 2020 from director Paul W. S. Anderson and actress Milla Jovovich, the husband-and-wife team behind the first six Resident Evil films. However, Monster Hunter's dismal $47.9 million worldwide box office has seemingly killed any prospect of a sequel. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has enjoyed an exceptional year, becoming the most-nominated game in the history of The Game Awards. Its cast--Ben Starr, Charlie Cox, and Jennifer English among them--earned major recognition in the show's performance categories, helping cement the game as one of the year's standout achievements. But even while celebrating this success, the cast has been discussing ways the awards could grow, especially when it comes to recognizing the full range of performance work that brings modern games to life. In an interview with Video Games Chronicle, cast members English, Shayla Nyx, Devora Wilde, and Aliona Baranova shared their hope that The Game Awards will eventually expand its performance categories. They explained that, while the nominations are an honor, the current categories overlook many essential performers. \"If I may, can I put my petition forward for why we need to have a motion capture category?\" Baranova said. \"It's been decades of actors going in, doing the mocap, and then someone else's voice is popped on top, and those mocap performers just disappear. I forgot that. Nobody knows about them.” Baranova, who worked as a motion capture director on Baldur's Gate 3, noted that this issue has persisted for years. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Sony's popular and longrunning professional baseball series, MLB The Show, is expanding to a new place: mobile. A new version of the game \"built from the ground up\" for mobile is headed to iOS and Android, with a test coming up soon in the Philippines before a global rollout later. The regional test for the Philippines begins today, December 3, but there is no word yet on when the game will be available in more places. This kind of limited, regional rollout is common for mobile games. A FAQ for The Show's mobile version confirms it is a standalone game that will not support cross-play with the console editions. The game is optimized for iPhone 16 or \"comparable devices\" in the Apple family, along with Samsung Galaxy S25, Sony Xperia V, or \"comparable\" phones. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The game had been set to release on Epic Games Store this week, but now Epic has banned Horses as well. Santa Ragione shared a lengthy statement on its site, as well as reproduced messages from Epic that broke the news about the cancellation a day before launch. The dispatch from Epic cites violations of its inappropriate content policy and hateful or abusive content policies. Epic also stated that Horses got an Adults Only rating, and those games are excluded from the store. In response, Santa Ragione mentioned that Epic approved the game for release just over three weeks ago, and that the actual rating for the game was M for Mature under the ESRB and PEGI 18 in international territories. The studio went on to explain again that Horses is not a sexually charged adult game. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Samus Aran might not be known as a chatty character, but a voice actor helps flesh out the heroine with grunts and mumbles. Jennifer Hale, probably best known as Commander Shepard in the Mass Effect trilogy, previously provided the voice for Samus in the first three Metroid Prime games. But for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, Erin Yvette voices the protagonist and Krystle Martin provides the motion capture, per Nintendo Life. This isn't the first time Yvette has worked with Nintendo. Her previous experience with the company includes voicing Neilnail in Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition and Great Fairy Cotera in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. Meanwhile, IGN asked Hale about reprising her Metroid Prime role recently, and the actress seemingly implied she wasn't involved this time. \"I don't know,\" Hale said. \"I have no recollection of recording it or signing a contract, so it could be no.\" Hale has been on the flip side of this before, too, with Bayonetta 3. She isn't the first voice actor replaced by Nintendo in recent years. In June, longtime Princess Peach and Toad voice actor Samantha Kelly revealed she was no longer playing those parts after not being involved with Mario Kart World. In 2023, Super Mario Bros. Wonder introduced a new voice for Mario and Luigi--Kevin Afghani. This came after Charles Martinet stepped back from voicing the iconic character following a 25-year stint.
