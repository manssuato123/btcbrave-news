On December 22, Sega and Rovio will unleash Toho's iconic monster on Dr. Eggman's Toy World with a new stage: Godzilla Survival. The goal of that stage is simple. Players simply have to survive a Godzilla attack in the middle of the ocean while running from boat to boat. Trust us, you don't want to be stuck when Godzilla unleashes his atomic fire. Players will only get a single respawn on this stage, so run as if your virtual life depends upon it. Because it does. Sonic Rumble's free pass will unlock Godzilla and his fellow monster, Fire Rodan, without charging players. However, the premium pass will unlock Mothra and King Ghidorah, and it gives Godzilla his nuclear pulse ability in addition to his heat ray. The RSR Shop will also allow players to purchase Mecha Godzilla and his Absolute Zero blast as well as Destroyah and his Variable Slicer ability. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Smith appeared on the My Perfect Console podcast recently and said (via Eurogamer), \"Every company makes the decisions they make for the reasons they make them.\" For Arkane Austin's closure, Smith said the \"shock\" was that Arkane--as a wider group that also comprised Dishonored studio Arkane Lyon--made well-received and commercially successful games.

Players will be able to take control of four of the iconic characters from the show--Rick Grimes, Daryl Dixon, Negan, and Michonne--with The Walking Dead stars Andrew Lincoln and Norman Reedus reprising their roles as Rick and and Daryl, respectively. The first trailer for the crossover should look very familiar to fans of both franchises. The new episodic campaign will unfold over three stories that revisit locations from The Walking Dead, including Grady Memorial Hospital, the Prison, and the Alexandria Safe Zone. But don't count on facing The Walking Dead's infamously slow hordes of walkers. This DLC is pitting the characters against a new incarnation of World War Z's Zeke swarms. There's also a fresh take on a Zeke called Spiked Walkers. This zombie is impervious to melee attacks unless it's been knocked over. However, the window of opportunity to take it out is short, and once it's back on its feet, it's no longer vulnerable. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
