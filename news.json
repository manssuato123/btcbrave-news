    "description": "Disney's Stitch 17-inch Interactive Plush $50 (was $70) See at Amazon Stitch Interactive Plush (14in.) $30 (was $46) See at Amazon While Amazon's official Black Friday sale hasn't started just yet, we're already seeing early deals on everything from video games and hardware to movies and toys. One such deal is for the 17-inch interactive Stitch plush from Just Play, which is down to $50 (was $70) for a limited time. The 17-inch figure moves and speaks with over 100 voice lines, making for a life-like gift for fans of the movie. You can check out more info on the deal below, as well as see a few more Lilo and Stitch toys and collectibles that are on sale at Amazon. Disney's Stitch 17-inch Interactive Plush $50 (was $70) This life-sized interactive plush is inspired by the live-action remake of Lilo &amp; Stitch that premiered earlier this year. It comes with six AA batteries to power its over 100 sound bites and motion features, and can be activated in multiple spots: touch his nose, tongue, belly, and left hand to get him moving and talking. A similar 17-inch interactive plush figure for Angel--the pink alien of the same species as Stitch who first debuted in the Lilo &amp; Stitch animated series that ran from 2003 to 2006--is also available. This one isn't on sale, so expect to pay the full $70 for her, but she has all the same features as the Stitch figure, and is worth considering as a companion for Stitch in your collection. See at Amazon Stitch Interactive Plush (14in.) $30 (was $46) If the 17-inch version is a bit too expensive, there's also a 14-inch interactive Stich plush on sale for just $30 (was $46). This one features over 50 sounds and effects and light-up LED eyes that can be changed to different styles at the push of a button. The doll comes with three AA batteries. See at Amazon If your loved one still enjoys the movies and is more of a LEGO fan, they're in luck. LEGO has a handful of impressively detailed sets pulled straight from the films. The buildable Stitch and Angel figures are to-scale versions of the characters, complete with props and modular mobility. The Beach House set is a faithful recreation of the titular family's house made up of over 800 pieces. All three sets are also currently on sale for up to 20% off as part of Amazon's Black Friday deals.

Major retailers such a Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target are hosting early Black Friday video game promotions filled with dozens of notable games and collections. We're keeping running lists of the best Black Friday Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 game deals you can buy now. Bookmark this page, because we'll be updating this roundup through Black Friday and Cyber Week. See Switch deals at Amazon See Switch 2 deals at Amazon See all gaming deals at Amazon We separated Nintendo Switch 2 and Switch games into two lists, but keep in mind that original Switch games are playable on Nintendo's new console. Some original Switch games have received free or paid Switch 2 upgrades, and others simply run better on the more powerful hardware by default. Black Friday Nintendo Switch 2 Game Deals The Nintendo Switch 2 list is, rather unsurprisingly, significantly shorter than the Switch list, but there are numerous titles on sale for all-time low prices. Multiple EA Sports and 2K Sports titles are at least 50% off. Madden NFL 26 and EA Sports FC 26 are down to $35 (was $70). Basketball fans can save even more by snagging NBA 2K26 fo only $30 (was $70). Outside of sports, you'll find the recently released Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake for $50 (was $60), Hogwarts Legacy for $50 (was $60), and Sid Meier's Civilization VII for $45 (was $70).

    "title": "The \"Weird Found Family\" Behind Metaphor: ReFantazio",
    "description": "Though this year's awards season is just around the corner, lately I've found myself reminiscing about my favorite game of 2024 and, coincidentally, GameSpot's 2024 Game of the Year: Metaphor: ReFantazio. The fantasy RPG quickly captivated me upon its release late last year for myriad reasons, but perhaps what impressed me most about Metaphor was Atlus' ability to make this high-stakes, fantastical adventure ultimately feel grounded and deeply human. Perhaps this shouldn't have been as surprising as it was considering Atlus's catalog of games, many of which tactfully explore ideas like mortality, oppression, and self-actualization. But whereas the Persona titles and the studio's one-off games like Catherine are still rooted in real-life, Metaphor offered a dramatic departure from our world. A large part of what grounds this, of course, is the game's writing and overarching story, but another part of what truly makes this work are the Metaphor's fantastic performances. As such, I was delighted when the actor behind Metaphor's protagonist, Caleb Yen, volunteered to answer some questions about his performance and time spent working on the game. Yen opened up to GameSpot about his favorite lines, how to inject humor into an earnest character, and that awkwardness that comes with playing a game he's in. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "This week, Fortnite made the jump to Xbox PC Store, which is the first time the game has been available on a launcher outside of the Epic Game Store. Unfortunately for both Epic and Microsoft, the transition appears to be going very badly. As demonstrated on social media by The Verge's Tom Warren, Fortnite's Xbox PC Store launcher almost immediately goes to an error message and a crash. Warren later noted that he applied an update to the game, and attributed the problem to \"the typical Xbox PC launch woes.\" Fortnite is launching on the Xbox PC store today, but the launch isn’t going well 😬 pic.twitter.com/poaG2IkLOu — Tom Warren (@tomwarren) November 18, 2025 A player on X named Nick added that the Fortnite's initial download on his Xbox PC Store launcher had no audio and dropped frames. \"Uninstalled and reinstalled after patch and now it doesn't work,\" added Nick. Another player suggested that Epic's decision to push back an update may have played a role in causing the error on Xbox PC Store. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
