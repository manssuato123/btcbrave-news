It shows what games you played, how much time you spent playing, and other simple stats from the year. Many platforms now do yearly summaries like this, with Spotify Wrapped starting the trend, and services like YouTube and Twitch followed by showing users what they watched and enjoyed in 2025. Valve's Steam Replay covers your playtime from January 1, 2025, through the end of December 14, 2025. This gives players a clear picture of most of their gaming year, and also focuses on their habits--such as how many games they played games with either a keyboard or controller--and highlights their most-played games. This year, I finally really got into games on Steam with Peak and Repo, and I'm still dabbling with Lethal Company. It's the most wonderful time of the year - Steam Replay 2025 is now available!Take a trip down memory lane and see how many games you played, how much you played per month, and many more fun stats for the year.Check out yours (login required): https://t.co/Zq9vxaFit4… pic.twitter.com/SrVS9oNdIP — Steam (@Steam) December 16, 2025 Other gaming platforms have also released their yearly summaries, as PlayStation posted its yearly wrap-up last week. To see your Steam Replay, you can visit Valve's website or click the Steam Replay banner in the Steam app's store page.

Keep in mind that you need to complete every step of this quest in a single round. This means that dying before you wrap things up will result in you having to redo the steps next time you load in. However, you do not need to extract to get credit for completion, so once you've finished the quest, dying won't be as big of a deal. We'd still recommend you try to extract, though, of course.

    "description": "In January 2026, it will be seven and a half years since the announcement teaser for The Elder Scrolls 6. In that time, Bethesda has had remarkably little to say about it or even a trailer to show off. Now, Bethesda's Todd Howard has indicated that most of the Bethesda team is working on The Elder Scrolls 6. \"It's progressing really well,\" Howard told Game Informer. \"The majority of the studio's on [Elder Scrolls 6]. but I'll say this: We always overlap. So, we're very used to overlapping development. And we have long pre-productions on things so that we feel good about them. And it's a process. We all wish it went a little bit faster--or a lot faster--but it's a process that we want to get right.\" Although the initial announcement came years ago, it's possible or even likely that development didn't ramp up on The Elder Scrolls until after Starfield was released in 2023. Fans are so desperate for any kind of update that they're reading things in the Skyrim Switch 2 announcement trailer as if they're hidden hints about an Elder Scrolls 6 release window.

    "description": "Total War: Warhammer 40,000's four asymmetrical factions will vary wildly from one another, as developer Creative Assembly has now outlined how some of the game's factions will play and be \"totally different\" from factions seen before in the Total War franchise. After being announced during The Game Awards, more details about developer Creative Assembly's next game have been revealed via a new developer roundtable. The four factions players will have to choose from include Space Marines, Astra Militarum, Orks, and Aeldari. Mann said the universe has a lot of opportunities for asymmetry between the factions, and Creative Assembly knew that it could only pick a limited number of playable factions in order to give each one the amount of effort to make them feel special. In terms of how they play, each faction will field troops, gather resources, and engage in battle in different ways. Of the four factions, Astra Milatrum is said to be the most \"traditional\" Total War faction, with mass ranks of infantry and support from artillery and vehicles. Like in other Total War games, Astra Militarum players will need to gather resources, build infrastructure, and recruit more troops in order to succeed. In true Astra Militarum fashion, solving problems will often mean throwing more masses of bodies at it. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

In the free trial, which runs December 16-22, players can access 20+ maps and try the Ashes of the Damned map for Zombies. In terms of modes, players can try out mainstays like Team Deathmatch, Hardpoint, Domination, and Kill Confirmed, as well as the Holiday Havoc mode and Prop Hunt. Alongside this, Activision has discounted Black Ops 7 by up to 30%. This brings the price down to from $70 to $49 for the standard edition, or from $100 to $80 for the Vault Edition.
