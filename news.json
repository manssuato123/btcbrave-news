See at Amazon See at Best Buy See at Target Switch 2 Amiibo Black Friday Deals Zelda Amiibo for $10 / Street Fighter Amiibo for $15 See at Best Buy See at Amazon Nintendo's official Black Friday 2025 promotion on exclusive games has arrived with steep discounts on some of the best Switch games at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. The sale features Mario games from a variety of genres, the latest mainline Zelda game, charming Kirby and Donkey Kong side-scrollers, and more. In the RPG and 3D platforming corners of the Super Mario franchise, two of the best Nintendo games ever made are on sale for 50% off: Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Super Mario Odyssey. You can also save 50% on a few rarely discounted games, including The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom and Princess Peach: Showtime. In addition to the game deals, you can snag the Amiibo figures that launched alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 for cheap at Best Buy. The Legend of Zelda Amiibo are only $10 each, and Street Fighter 6 Amiibo are $15 each. Nintendo Switch Exclusives: Black Friday Game Deals Only three of the nine games featured in the sale were supposed to be 50% off, but Target cut an extra $10 from Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Princess Peach: Showtime, and Donkey Kong Country Returns HD. Amazon quickly matched these $30 deals, so the actual number of half-off deals is six. If physical editions of the games listed below sell out, digital versions are eligible at multiple retailers, including Amazon and Best Buy. That said, the digital codes align with Nintendo's official price points, so Echoes of Wisdom is $40 instead of $30. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

One of the devices on sale is its handheld game-streaming unit, the PlayStation Portal, which is going for $179 (was $200). Available in two colors--Midnight Black and White--the handheld merges a sharp display with a DualSense Controller to let you stream games over Wi-Fi. While you originally needed a PS5 console to use it, a recent update unlocked full cloud-streaming capabilities for the PS Portal. PlayStation Portal (Midnight Black) $179 (was $200) The PS Portal has an 8-inch LCD screen, and the attached controller grips offer the same haptic feedback and adaptive triggers found on the DualSense controller. Sony has also updated the device to make switching between cloud streaming and remote play from your PS5 easier. As long as you have a strong Wi-Fi connection, you'll be able to play any of the games in your PlayStation library. Cloud streaming does require a PS Plus Premium membership, and nearly 3,000 games support the feature. PlayStation Link technology, developed for the PS Portal, allows for low latency and lossless audio. PlayStation's Pulse Explore Earbuds and Pulse Elite Headset have PlayStation Link and are an ideal audio option for anyone who picks up the PlayStation Portal deal. Pulse Explore Wireless Earbuds are discounted to $169 (was $200), while the Pulse Elite Headset is down to $129 (was $150). See at Amazon See at PS Direct See at Walmart PlayStation Portal (White) $179 (was $200) The White model has the same specs as the Midnight Black version and simply offers a color option that closely matches the PS5--unless you swap out the white console covers with Midnight Black or one of the more colorful designs.

PS5 and PC players can grab the Midnight Black or white version of the premium wireless controller for $169 (was $200) at Amazon and Walmart. Technically, that's a $31 discount, because Walmart and Amazon have a habit of beating the competition by $1. The DualSense Edge is available for $170 at PS Direct and other major retailers, including Target and Best Buy. Amazon and Walmart had the DualSense Edge for $160 in the days leading up to the official promotion's November 20 start date, but those offers quickly sold out each time they popped up. The DualSense Edge is to the PS5 what the Elite Series 2 is to Xbox. If you can stomach the price--even with the deal, it's nearly three times the cost of the white and Midnight Black regular DualSense Controllers--the DualSense Edge is a fantastic controller for PS5 and PC.

The 1,048-piece model is 50% off, lowering the price to just $50 (was $100). Amazon first offered this deal on November 13 before the Black Friday sale officially kicked off. Unsurprisingly, Amazon has sold out multiple times over the past week, so the deal is unlikely to remain in stock for very long. Grogue with Hover Pram is one of two official Black Friday Lego deals at Amazon (so far); the other deal is on a nostalgic diorama based on a scene from Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope. The 502-piece Boarding the Tantive IV diorama is up for grabs for only $38.49 (was $55). Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Horror fans should hurry, because this box set sold out hours after we originally published this story on November 16. Read our original story below. Shout Factory recently discontinued one of its best horror movie box sets, but there's still time to add it to your collection before it's gone for good. Friday the 13th Collection Deluxe Edition is back in stock at Amazon with a huge 34% discount that drops the price to $105 (was $160). Released in 2020 to rave reviews from fans and critics, this 16-disc Blu-ray box set is the only Friday the 13th collection with all 12 movies.

See at Amazon Nintendo's official Black Friday promotion begins this Sunday, November 23, but with sales events running already at Amazon and Best Buy, you already have a massive selection of discounted Switch and Switch 2 games to choose from. If you clicked on this article earlier in the week, you browsed a list of roughly 85 deals on physical games for Switch 1/2. Many of the early Black Friday Switch deals are still available, but they have been joined by so many others. Our list has practically doubled in size, so now Switch and Switch 2 players have around 170 game deals to check out below. And if you haven't already, you may want to bookmark this page, because we'll continue to update this roundup throughout Black Friday and Cyber Week. See Switch deals at Amazon See Switch 2 deals at Amazon See all gaming deals at Amazon See Switch game deals at Best Buy We separated Nintendo Switch 2 and Switch games into two lists, but keep in mind that original Switch games are playable on Nintendo's new console. Some original Switch games have received free or paid Switch 2 upgrades, and others simply run better on the more powerful hardware by default. Black Friday Nintendo Switch 2 Game Deals The Nintendo Switch 2 list is, rather unsurprisingly, significantly shorter than the Switch list, but there are numerous titles on sale for all-time low prices, including recent releases like Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac, Little Nightmares III, Cronos, and Star Wars Outlaws: Gold Edition, which is discounted to $40 (was $60) at Amazon. The sports game deals are even better than earlier in the week, as Madden NFL 26, EA Sports FC 26, and NBA 2K26 are going for $30 (was $70) each.

    "description": "Earlier this year, Hytale was canceled after spending a decade in development and the studio behind it, Hypixel, was slated to be closed as well. Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme subsequently revived the company and purchased all of the rights for Hytale from Riot Games. Collins-Laflamme also reiterated his commitment to releasing Hypixel in early access. Now, we know how much the game is going to cost. On social media, Hypixel revealed that Hytale will retail for $20. However, there will be more expensive editions with perks including cosmetics that fans can purchase in support of the team. After confirming the price, Collins-Laflamme noted that this decision puts him financially at risk because he's already committed to bankrolling his company and funding the game out of his own pocket. \"I'm pricing Hytale as aggressively low as possible,\" wrote Collins-Laflamme on X. \"I'm taking on a considerable personal risk after repurchasing the game and getting it ready for early access for a growing team of now 50 talented individuals. I said I was all in, and I am delivering on that promise. The game is unfinished and runs on a build from over four years ago. Charging more didn't feel right. I don't think the game is good yet. My team and I will push hard to make it good, then great. The vision is clear and progress is fast.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",
