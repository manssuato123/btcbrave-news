You're going to have to pay a little bit extra for that side-scrolling shoot-'em-up, as the price is going up to €70. It's worth noting that those who already preordered the physical Special Edition will not see their price change. Publisher Inin Games had previously explained that switching the entire run to standard cartridges would have resulted in manufacturing costs increasing by \"at least\" €15 per game copy, which is why it chose the Game-Key Card option. Inin Games pledged to look for a way to release the full game on a Switch cartridge, leading to today's news about the costs increasing, but not as much as it anticipated.

Their first car, the Afeela 1, will be released next year and it will include the capability of playing PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 games. However, this a limitation to what players can do with their Afeela In-Vehicle Infotainment systems. Sony and Honda aren't including in-car consoles, and they are relying on PlayStation Remote Play for this to work. That means Afeela 1 owners will also need to have either a PS5 or a PS4 at their homes in order to connect with the systems to play games. Sony notes that this use of Remote Play is separate from streaming PS Plus games from the cloud. The Afeela In-Vehicle Infotainment system.This setup includes integrated display and premium audio systems for passengers.

    "title": "There Is No Xbox Wrapped This Year -- Here’s Why It Might Not Be Happening",
    "description": "It's almost the end of 2025, and in the spirit of Spotify Wrapped, several big companies have invited subscribers to review their last year of activity. Sony got the ball rolling with the PlayStation Wrap-Up, Steam offers a similar annual roundup, and the Nintendo Switch Year in Review recap has been announced for early next year--but where is Xbox in the middle of all this? While it doesn't offer an Xbox wrap-up every year, it still feels odd for Microsoft's gaming brand to skip 2025. The year has seen several high-profile releases from the company and the launch of an Xbox-branded handheld gaming PC alongside Asus, but according to Windows Central, Microsoft is allocating its marketing budget toward celebrating several major anniversaries in 2026. The Xbox brand celebrates its 25th anniversary next year, Blizzard has its 35th anniversary to look forward to, and Bethesda is turning 40. Those are several significant milestones in proximity to each other, and it's a safe bet that Microsoft wants to accommodate them, possibly explaining the lack of an Xbox Wrapped this year. On top of that, we'll see the return of BlizzCon in September, and Blizzard has teased its \"biggest year yet\" for 2026. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Cross's exit comes just after the game was finally announced for a March 2026 release, following an indefinite delay prompted by underwhelming player feedback on the shooter's alpha tests. Cross's departure from Bungie was tipped by an update to his LinkedIn page and social accounts, and he confirmed to Kotaku that it was his choice to leave. \"I’m super proud of the project and what the team accomplished over the last six years,\" he said, reflecting on his exit. After years of work on Destiny as lead concept artist, Cross returned to Bungie in 2020 to help shape the visual style for Marathon. The extraction shooter is looking to be one of Bungie's most visually unique titles, with a bold aesthetic named by Cross as \"graphic realism.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Ohlen has headed up the Wizards of the Coast-owned studio since its founding in 2019, working on the studio's debut title Exodus. \"At this stage, James felt his work on the game was complete and that the polishing and tuning were in great hands with the team,\" Hasbro said in a statement given to Bloomberg. Exodus is still fairly far from release, which is currently scheduled for early 2027. This is an unusually long window if the game is already up to the polishing and tuning stage.

Bloomberg initially reported on Riot's plans for a 2027 LoL refresh earlier this week, saying the update was internally known as \"League Next.\" Shortly after that report was released, Riot Games confirmed the plans via a video posted to League of Legends' social media. League boss Andrei Van Roon added that the video was intended to be released in January, but had been pushed forward in response to the report.

First and foremost is a brand-new \"around-game\" client, which will be bundled in with the game as a single application. Summoner's Rift is also due for an overhaul, with the studio promising \"entirely new visuals\" for the classic map, as well as some new gameplay.
