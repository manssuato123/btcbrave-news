    "title": "After 120 Hours In Arc Raiders, I Finally Killed Another Player",
    "description": "The Arc Raiders Achievement/Trophy for killing another player in PvP combat is titled \"Crossing The Threshold,\" and after 120 hours of intentional pacifistic gameplay, when I saw that alert come across my screen, I felt like I had done exactly that: I'd waded into uncharted territory. More than that, I'd found myself in a world I didn't even want to be in. I'd prided myself on never killing another player in the game. Through dozens and dozens of rounds, I'd gone well out of my way to avoid such an outcome, often being slow to shoot first, even to my own detriment. I put my trust in other players, and sometimes it would prove unwarranted. Mostly, I'd resorted to diplomacy, often talking my way out of problems with other players I'd encounter. I had so many big ideas about what it takes to return to Speranza without blood on one's hands. To me, Arc Raiders was this exciting social experiment. How long can I effectively talk down other players who means me harm? In the end, the answer was about 122 hours of play. The fateful encounter occurred on Stella Montis, which will be no surprise to some Arc Raiders veterans. This newest map, and the first to take place entirely indoors, is an ultra-tense setting where you are either diligently checking your corners or you're soon bleeding out on the ground. Even in solo queues, where Arc Raiders remains mostly the bastion of good-natured and helpful PvE-only players, it feels like Stella Montis is kill-or-be-killed more than the game's other maps. I was minding my own business, cautiously looting but certainly not planning to hurt anyone, when I heard some gunfire nearby. Hiding behind some lockers, I had a clear view of this fight, except for when it wrapped into the next room via the open doors leading to a hallway. I was still within range to hear the proximity chat of those who were scrapping, and witnessed with my eyes and/or ears a scuffle that took the lives of at least two players, whose flares shot toward the ceiling from inside the hallway. I crouched a safe distance away from the noise, then continued exploring other rooms. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "YouTube has published its list of the top trending topics of 2025, and once again, gaming and pop culture were popular choices for what people watched on the video-streaming website. Out of the trending topics--which aren't ranked in any particular order--US YouTube viewers devoured any content related to the Switch 2 console, Roblox, and the RPG-strategy game Cookie Run Kingdom. Other topics of interest in the US included KPop Demon Hunters, Labubu collectible dolls, and the hit anime series Blue Lock. Roblox user-generated experiences and the Switch 2 continued to be popular topics on YouTube worldwide, especially in countries such as Korea, Germany, Mexico, France, Japan, and the United Kingdom. YouTube says that it determined the top trends for the US and other regions through \"a variety of signals,\" including views, uploads, and creator activity around the topics. Only the topics that were determined to have had conspicuous popularity this year--either because they were new to 2025 or because they saw significant increases in their user-interest metrics--were eligible for the list.

While much of the conversation naturally touched on his long history with Sony, one of the most surprising and heartfelt moments came when he talked about his love for Nintendo's Pikmin. Despite his deep ties to PlayStation, Cerny made it clear that Pikmin left a lasting mark on him. Cerny described playing the original Pikmin as a truly \"transformative\" experience. He explained how emotionally invested he became in Captain Olimar's struggle to survive and return home. \"I had this thing where I tended to play smaller, lighter games for about 10 years, so I don't know, Portal or Plants vs. Zombies or Flower or Katamari Damacy. Pikmin, I just [picked] out of that list because I thought it was such an emotionally involving story,\" Cerny explained. \"Poor Captain Olimar, he crash lands, and he's got 30 days to reassemble his ship, or he'll run out of oxygen and die, and he's sending letters home every day.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle $449 (was $500) See at Walmart See at Amazon Walmart's Nintendo Switch 2 console deal is still live after Cyber Monday. As of December 2 at 6:45 AM PT, the Mario Kart World Switch 2 bundle is selling for $449 (was $50). The promotion could end any minute. The deal has disappeared from Target and Best Buy's online stores, and Amazon sold out of units on Cyber Monday. Discounts on Nintendo consoles are rare in general, but it's genuinely shocking to see a deal on the Switch 2 less than six months after launch. The $51 discount will show up after you add the bundle to your cart at Walmart. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

On Switch 2, Metroid Prime 4 comes in at an estimated 31.6GB, while the original Switch version only takes up 26.3GB, per the Nintendo Store. Intriguingly, though, the eShop accessed via Switch 2 showcases the Switch edition as taking up 28.9GB. Regardless, it makes sense Metroid Prime 4 has a bigger download size on Switch 2, since the game offers 4K visuals in quality mode docked and 120fps in performance mode docked. There is also HDR support and mouse controls, courtesy of the Switch 2 Joy-Con controllers. Both versions will launch this Thursday, December 4. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
