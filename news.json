The Marvel's Spider-Man Bundle, which has been hard to find at Amazon for more than a month, was restocked December 19 for $48.49 (was $70)--and promptly sold out again. Thankfully, Target still has units available for the same price. The bundle comes with nine Play Booster Packs, an Alternate-Art Foil Promo Card, 30 Basic Land Cards, a Spider-Man-themed storage box, and a few other items. But before you buy the standard bundle, check out the Marvel's Spider-Man Gift Bundle for $64 (was $90). The Gift Bundle comes with everything featured in the standard bundle as well as one Collector Booster Pack, which are going for just under $40 on their own. Both Marvel's Spider-Man booster boxes are on sale for roughly $100 off. The Play Booster Box has dropped all the way down to $112, which means each of the 30 Booster Packs will cost you an average of $3.73. Each Play Booster includes 14 cards, so you're getting 420 cards total. The Collector Booster Box, meanwhile, is discounted to $357 (was $455.88). Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "While Sony and Nintendo have expanded their lead over Xbox, a dark horse console had a very strong showing in third place in November. The Nex Playground has emerged as a breakout hit, and CEO David Lee believes that one of the reasons why its been so successful is because the console has solved the Wii \"problem.\" Nearly two decades ago, the Wii powered Nintendo's post-GameCube comeback with its motion controls and unique games. Lee argues that the scope of Wii's success made it difficult to sustain in the long term. Instead of trying to sell games like Wii, Nex Playground is offering its titles as part of a subscription service. \"One of the most important things we should do is learn from history and try not to commit the same limitations, and that's why we have a subscription model,\" Lee told The Game Business. \"Nintendo expanded the audience with Wii. When you expand the audience, and they want different things, and they only buy Wii Fit, Wii Sports and not many others … that's a bit of a problem.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Save Up To 25% On The Akira Manga Hardcover Edition",
    "description": "Akira Hardcover Collection Save Up To 25% See all volumes at Amazon Any list gathering up the best that anime has to offer will inevitably include Akira, and for good reason. The 1988 movie raised the bar for film animation and is widely credited with introducing mainstream audiences outside Japan to the medium. However, the anime adaptation is only part of the tale. Like innumerable other anime projects, Akira is adapted from a much longer--though lesser-known--manga series. While the Akira manga has been available in print for decades, a new Akira Hardcover Edition kicked off earlier in 2025, offering the most authentic presentation of Katsuhiro Otomo's groundbreaking sci-fi saga. If you've ever wanted to experience the full Akira saga, this is one of the best ways to do so--and as luck would have it, you can save a few dollars on these premium hardcover releases. Four volumes in the six-volume series are available to purchase at Amazon, and while these normally cost between $30 and $40, you can get them for up 25% off. Volumes 5 and 6 are also launching in the coming weeks, and preorders are live. Akira Hardcover Collection Save Up To 25% The Akira Hardcover books published by Kodansha use the updated translation and lettering of the 35th Anniversary Edition box set, and each book is presented as a large-sized 7\" x 10\" collectible. Like traditional manga, they are read from right to left, and the original Japanese-language hand-drawn sound effects from the manga have been restored. Each hardcover book has cover artwork based on the original manga tankabon volume artwork. As mentioned above, four volumes have launched so far, and are currently discounted to roughly $26 - $27 at Amazon (normally $30 - $35 each). The next release, Akira Hardcover Collection 5, releases on December 23. Preorders are discounted to $34 (down from $36). This will be followed by Akira Hardcover Collection 6, a month later on January 27, 2026. Preorders for volume six are available for $40. Check out all the Akira Hardcover Collection releases below. Akira Hardcover Collection 1 -- $26.61 ($35) Akira Hardcover Collection 2 -- $26.61 ($35) Akira Hardcover Collection 3 -- $25.70 ($30) Akira Hardcover Collection 4 -- $27.61 ($35) Akira Hardcover Collection 5 -- $34 ($36) | Releases December 23 Akira Hardcover Collection 6 -- $40 | Releases January 27, 2026 See all volumes at Amazon While the hardcover editions above are fresh reprints, you can also pick up all six of them as part of the Akira 35th Anniversary Manga Box Set. All six volumes come bundled together with the hardcover Akira Club art book and an exclusive pill patch. It's currently sold out, but it gets restocked periodically at Amazon, so it's worth checking back to see if it's available. Set in a dark future timeline, Akira first began publication in 1982 and ran for 120 chapters. Taking place in the post-apocalyptic city of Neo-Tokyo, the series examines the after-effects of a mysterious explosion that almost destroyed the city. Thirty years later, teenage biker gang leader Shotaro Kaneda finds himself in the middle of a plot that involves militant revolutionaries, psychically gifted individuals, military forces, and his childhood friend, Tetsuo Shima, who has begun to develop dangerously destructive psychic powers of his own. Akira manga was critically acclaimed for its mature themes, well-developed characters, intriguing storylines, and Otomo's artwork. In the years since its publication, it's become regarded as one of the pioneering works in the then-burgeoning Cyberpunk sci-fi subgenre. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Available exclusively on Amazon, cinephiles--or shoppers looking to get something for their dad--can grab the Totally Awesome 80s 4K Blu-ray bundle. The collection, which launched just a few days ago on December 16, includes 4K Blu-ray editions of five acclaimed 1980s films, plus bonus materials and digital streaming copies of each movie. The Totally Awesome 80s bundle in stock and available for $55 at Amazon. Totally Awesome 80s Box Set (4K) $55 The Totally Awesome 80s Box Set compiles 4K Blu-ray editions of five classic movies released by Paramount Pictures throughout the 1980s: Beverly Hills Cop Ferris Bueller's Day Off Top Gun Trading Places The Untouchables That's a nice selection of some of the decade's most notable action, comedy, and drama flicks. The 4K Blu-ray releases for each film support Dolby Vision, HDR10, and Dolby Atmos audio, and offer their own selection of bonus materials, including new behind-the-scenes documentaries, deleted scenes, music videos, audio commentary tracks, and more. See at Amazon If you've never seen these films, then you've missed out on some of the most influential movies of all time. Top Gun was a blockbuster hit that cemented Tom Cruise's stardom, combining incredible aerial photography and action set against some of the era's chart-topping pop and rock songs. Ferris Bueller's Day Off, one of John Hughes' best films, follows Bueller (Mathew Broderick), his girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara), and his best bud Cameron (Alan Ruck) as they take an unscheduled break from school. The Untouchables is a ruthless turn-of-the-century gangster movie with an all-star cast, while Trading Places saw John Landis put his own spin on Wall Street, and Beverly Hills Cop is a breakout action-comedy hit that made Eddie Murphy a household name.

    "description": "Pokemon TCG: Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection $140 (was $250) See at Amazon Mega Venusaur ex Premium Collection $74.89 See at Amazon Amazon has dropped the price of the Pokemon Trading Card Game's latest Ultra-Premium Collection. After initially restocking the Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection with a $165 asking price, Amazon is now selling the large collection of boosters and promo cards for $140. The Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection had sold for as high as $250 before launch and was $211 on launch day (November 14). It launched alongside Pokemon TCG's latest expansion set, Mega Evolution - Phantasmal Flames. Pokemon TCG collectors can also pick up the newly released Mega Venusaur ex Premium Collection for $74.89 at Amazon. Released earlier this month, the latest Mega Pokemon Premium Collection has been difficult to find in stock, so we wouldn't be surprised if it sold out again soon. Speaking of Premium Collections, the Lugia ex &amp; Latias ex Premium Collection is back in stock for $100. Amazon also has a brand-new Pokemon TCG listing that has yet to be noticed by resellers. The Holiday 2025 Poke Ball Tins are available to order for $30 each. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Donkey Kong and Pauline Amiibo $20 (was $30) Get deal at Amazon Donkey Kong fans can grab the Donkey Kong Bananza Amiibo for $20 (was $30) at Amazon right now. This is a Lightning Deal with limited quantities. At the time of writing, over 20% of the available Donkey Kong and Pauline Amiibo figures have been claimed. Amazon also has deals on two Amiibo figures that launched alongside the Nintendo Switch 2: Yunobo from The Legend of Zelda and Jamie from Street Fighter 6 are available for $8 each. Meanwhile, GameStop has all seven Switch 2 Amiibo launch figures for $6 each. The Legend of Zelda: Yunobo Amiibo -- $8 ($30) Street Fighter 6: Jamie Amiibo -- $8 ($40) Donkey Kong Bananza: Donkey Kong and Pauline -- $20 ($30) Donkey Kong and Pauline Amiibo $20 (was $30) Based on DK's wide smile, we imagine he's punching his way to a Banandium Gem. He's also moving fast because Pauline's legs are dangling in the air. The uneven ground beneath DK's feet aligns with rocky terrain found in Ingot Isle, Lagoon Layer, and other locales from the game. As for its functionality in the game, scanning the Donkey Kong and Pauline Amiibo grants two main perks. You can unlock Pauline's Diva Dress a lot earlier in your adventure with the Amiibo. The Diva Dress doubles the likelihood of enemies dropping music discs. To unlock the Diva Dress, you need to talk to the NPC shaped like the Amiibo in the Resort Layer. The NPC will ask you to show them the Amiibo to claim your reward. Without the Amiibo, this particular outfit is locked behind post-game challenges. Scanning the Bananza Amiibo also spawns gold KONG letters that can be smashed to refill Bananergy. KONG tiles can also be spawned by scanning older Donkey Kong Amiibo figures. Get deal at Amazon Nintendo Switch 2 Amiibo Deals at GameStop As mentioned, GameStop is selling all four The Legend of Zelda Switch 2 Amiibo, the three Street Fighter 6 Amiibo, and the Street Fighter 6 Amiibo Card Starter Set for only $6 each as part of its last-minute holiday sale. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo Tulin -- $6 ($30) Sidon -- $6 ($30) Yunobo -- $6 ($30) Riju -- $6 ($30) Street Fighter 6 Amiibo Jamie -- $6 ($40) Luke -- $6 ($40) Kimberly -- $6 ($40) Street Fighter 6 Amiibo Card Starter Set -- $6 ($40) All Donkey Kong Amiibo Figures King K. Rool Amiibo (Donkey Kong) $18 (was $20) Preorder at Best Buy Most Amiibo figures featuring Donkey Kong characters are out of print, but King K. Rool received a Best Buy-exclusive reprint in September. Normally $20, Best Buy is selling the figure for $18. King K. Rool is the priciest preowned Amiibo in the series sold at GameStop, so fans who are interested in adding King K. Rool to their collection should snag one from Best Buy sooner rather than later. GameStop has two older Donkey Kong Amiibo for $18 each and two Diddy Kong Amiibo for $20 each. Amazon also has the Smash Bros. Series Donkey Kong Amiibo for $20, which would be its MSRP if reprinted today. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
