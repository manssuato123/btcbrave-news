    "description": "If you want to get your hands on nearly a dozen free Switch games this holiday season, now's your chance. Starting today, No Gravity Games is giving away one Switch title per day through December 19, on which day there will be three free games. However, there is a catch that works out in your favor. To claim a free game on Switch, players need to have claimed the previous day's title and maintained it in their library. You must also have at least one No Gravity title prior to claiming the first freebie, but there's a trick you can use to get that for free, too. Just visit No Gravity Games' official site and sign up for the newsletter, and you'll receive a free game. If you do this first, it will count as a \"purchased\" game from No Gravity and you're able to then claim the other games for free. If players do miss a day, they can rejoin the giveaway chain by purchasing the previous day's game, which will be available at a greatly reduced price. Each title becomes available for free at midnight PT and they will be available to claim on Nintendo's eShop until 11:59pm PT on the same day. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

However, Straley essentially left the game industry for several years despite that impressive track record. Now, Straley is sharing more details regarding his departure, following up on comments he made years ago. \"I had been there 18 years. That's a long time for anybody to be anywhere,\" Straley told Polygon. \"I need new problems to solve, I need new creative outlets. I'm not saying there wouldn't be opportunities there, but couple that feeling with the idea that I was working really, really hard at something that wasn’t mine.\" Straley went on to explain that he didn't jump to another AAA studio because he felt Naughty Dog was the \"pinnacle\" of developers that made the games he was interested in. And he didn't want to deal with \"a whole different bureaucratic or cultural system.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "New Metroid games are few and far between, so the launch of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond should have been a monumental event for the fanbase. Instead, eight years after its announcement, and 18 years after the previous game, Nintendo’s big December 2025 release landed with a loud thud. Already, this once highly anticipated title is poised to be one of the series' most divisive games, earning a spot alongside Other M and Federation Force. This isn't for lack of polish, as Prime 4 is indeed visually stunning and perhaps the greatest first-party showcase of graphics on the Nintendo Switch and its successor. But while it has its share of enthusiasts, it’s difficult not to feel underwhelmed by the final product in comparison to prior Prime games and even other, similar entries in the Metroidvania space that has grown in Nintendo’s frequent absence. The list of Metroidvania games from independent and third-party developers in the past decade alone is astonishing, with Ori and the Blind Forest, Axiom Verge, Hollow Knight, Dead Cells, Animal Well, and others throwing new concepts and innovations into the genre’s well of ideas. Hollow Knight and its follow-up, Silksong, have captivated players with their dense worldbuilding, roaming NPCs, and optional side objectives, all of which have come to define the critically acclaimed series. Nine Sols stood out with its intricate combat system, while more out-there games like pinball Metroidvania Yoku’s Island Express have proven anything can be a Metroidvania with the right amount of determination and creativity. Even Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown changed the game with something as simple as an in-game screenshot system to help with backtracking. The Metroidvania genre is rapidly iterating with a volume of unique takes. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
