    "description": "The Nex Playground is probably the most popular video game console in the US that most people don't even know exists. Case in point: Circana senior director Mat Piscatella has revealed that the cube console focused on motion controls has topped every single PS5 and Xbox SKU for units sold in the US for a holiday week. Nex Playground - The Active Play System $249 See at Amazon See at Walmart See at Target See at Best Buy On BlueSky, Piscatella posted the possibly shocking video game hardware statistics for the week ending November 22. The top-selling hardware option was Switch 2 bundled with Mario Kart World, with the Nex Playground at No. 2. Meanwhile, the PS5 Slim digital edition with 1TB came in third place. Obviously, there are multiple options when choosing a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S--various bundles and hard drive configurations--and each one represents a SKU. So one caveat with Circana's info is that the list isn't showing overall Switch 2, PS5, or Xbox Series X|S units sold. US best-selling hardware SKUs for week ending Nov 22, 2025, ranked on units sold: 1) NS2 Mario Kart World Bundle 2) NEX Playground Interactive Gaming System 3) PS5 Slim Digital 1 TB So that's neat. Source: Circana Retail Tracking Service — Mat Piscatella (@matpiscatella.bsky.social) December 3, 2025 at 5:25 PM In fact, this isn't the first time Nex Playground has upped Sony's system in the US for a short time. In July, the cubed console went on sale for Prime Day and sold more units over the past month than any PS5 option on Amazon. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

He said in a new interview that he doesn't have much experience playing the Fallout games, but he's well-versed in the Fallout lore thanks to YouTube videos. \"I'm very familiar with the lore,\" the Home Alone star told IGN. \"For sure. I've less hands-on experience with the games themselves, but that being said, I knew what I was walking into. When we [Culkin and actress Brenda Song] were watching the show, I would pause it for her and catch her up on like, 'Oh, that's what this means, or that means, or that kind of thing.' Even some of the subtle subtext of the show.\" Culkin, 45, said he's too busy these days to try to play video games, so he \"watched a lot of YouTube stuff\" for Fallout.

Sorry to disappoint, but can confirm Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time won't be at TGA this year 💖 — Prince of Persia™ (@princeofpersia) December 3, 2025 In June, Ubisoft noted that the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake is set to launch by March 31--the end of the company's current fiscal year. That was the second time Ubisoft stuck to that release timeline, too. However, it's been a bumpy road for the game since being announced in 2020. For instance, in 2022, the Prince of Persia remake switched developers to Ubisoft Montreal, the original team behind the Sands of Time series.

Audio changes tested in a recent Battlefield Labs mini-test will be deployed with the upcoming update, with the overall aim to prioritize the most important combat and vehicle sounds. The audio refresh includes a \"comprehensive pass\" on footstep audio that aims to make footstep sound effects more tactically useful to players who can hear it. The update also includes some improvements towards ongoing performance issues that sometimes cause important sounds not to play as intended, an issue that's especially prevalent on large maps. Rush and Breakthrough are also getting some balance changes designed to improve the game mode's flow, and even out the win rate between attacking and defending teams. Seige of Cairo, for example, will get a few boosts to the attacking side, including one more attacker tank in Sectors 1 and 3, and an updated capture area on B. Rush attackers are also getting a small boost, with changes to M-COM locations on Manhattan Bridge and Liberation Peak. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
