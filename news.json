After selling out in the lead-up to Christmas, the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Minifigure 6-Pack is back in stock for $30 at Amazon. Resellers have been selling Spider-Verse mystery boxes for around $50, so Amazon will probably sell out again soon. If you're interested in collecting this Lego minifigure series, now's the time to grab a box or two. Spider-Verse minifigures are sold out at all other major retailers and the Lego Store. Most retailers sold out shortly after the collection launched in September and never restocked the mystery boxes or singles. And with the Lego Minifigure Animal Series 28 Collection launching this week, it's unlikely the Spider-Verse minifigures stick around for much longer. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Tom and Jerry: The Golden Era Anthology (Blu-ray) $46.79 (was $60) Get deal at Amazon Tom and Jerry: The Golden Era Anthology is on sale for a nice discount at Amazon. The newly released Blu-ray collection is up for grabs for $46.79 (was $60). The Golden Era Anthology compiles over 100 classic animated shorts starring the iconic duo. The six-disc box set also comes with a wealth of bonus features and a physical sketchbook. The Golden Era Anthology is also available on DVD for $46.79 (was $55), though it doesn't include the bonus content disc or sketchbook. Warner Bros. released The Golden Era Anthology on December 2 to celebrate Tom and Jerry's 85th anniversary. Unsurprisingly, this awesome collection quickly became a bestseller when preorders opened in September. Though Amazon's store page notes a $60 MSRP, the retailer has listed the collection for as high as $66.49. Amazon previously offered the $46.79 deal in mid-December, but it disappeared within a day. Tom and Jerry: The Golden Era Anthology (Blu-ray) $46.79 (was $60) Part of the Warner Archive Collection, The Golden Era Anthology features 114 theatrical shorts across six discs. The shorts were restored in 1080p resolution and support DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0. Three of the shorts have stereo audio, while the rest are mono. The box set collects nearly 20 years of Tom and Jerry history. The animated shorts, which played before feature films, originally appeared in theaters from 1940 through 1958. All 114 shorts are presented in chronological order, and three of them--Casanova Cat, Mouse Cleaning, and His Mouse Friday--were completely remastered for the first time. The Golden Era Anthology's sixth disc is loaded with bonus content, including audio commentaries narrated by animation experts, featurettes, and extra shorts. Two of the featurettes are exclusive to this release: Lady of the House: The Story of Mammy Two Shoes and Animal Hijinks: The Friends and Foes of Tom. The included physical sketchbook features archival character art and designs. Special Features 20 audio commentaries 9 classic featurettes 2 new featurettes 3 bonus animated shorts 32-page sketchbook All told, The Golden Era Anthology includes approximately 20 hours of content. The cover art features Tom in his Zoot suit from the 1944 animated short The Zoot Cat. Get deal at Amazon Tom and Jerry: The Golden Era AnthologyThe Golden Era Anthology is notable for including two remastered shorts that had never received home media releases in the US: Mouse Cleaning and Casanova Cat. These are controversial Tom and Jerry episodes due to them being racially insensitive, and while they were scheduled to appear in Tom and Jerry: The Golden Collection Volume Two, that release was ultimately canceled. Older--and extremely dated--content like this has appeared in several other Warner Archive releases over the years, as the company has added disclaimers to these shorts to indicate their historical context, problematic nature, and racially insensitive jokes.

    "title": "Skin Deep Is 2025's Best Cat Game",
    "description": "My favorite moment in Skin Deep, an immersive sim and stealth game about rescuing cats and fighting your evil clone in deep space, was always the one immediately after a thoroughly developed plan inevitably went sideways. The skittish way that I was forced to sprint and crawl under a table or into a vent. The manner in which my strategy devolved into simply batting things off of shelves in order to incapacitate a roaming guard or noisily distract them from looking in my direction. The way that I leapt onto a guard's back, dug my claws in, and careened them into surfaces in order to knock them out. If you were to close your eyes, I'd argue you could almost hear that distinctive, feline yowl mid-action. In short, I think Skin Deep best captures the experience of being a cat, even if Nina Pasadena, the game's protagonist, is decidedly not one. And for this tremendous feat, I am rewarding it with the honor of being the best cat game of 2025. Long live Skin Deep. In a typical Skin Deep mission, I often tried to keep to the shadows, as is the norm for a game in its genre. I would relegate myself to the ventilation, the pipework surrounding it, and the undersides of tables. Like Batman, I skulked around the perimeter looking for a precise opening that'd enable me to punch a hole in the level's defenses while keeping my cover. Of course, in Skin Deep, it almost never worked out in my favor. Because I am not, in fact, Batman. I'm just a (cat) girl. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "PlayStation has revealed this month's batch of free games for PlayStation Plus subscribers. All PS Plus members will be able to claim Need For Speed Unbound, Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, and Core Keeper starting January 6 and they will remain available until Monday, February 2. NFS Unbound promo art.The most recent Need for Speed game, NFS Unbound, has single-player and multiplayer campaigns set in Lakeshore City, which greatly resembles Chicago. Street racing is a key part of the experience, but so is outrunning the cops. As your \"Heat\" index rises after each race, the police will pursue players with greater intensity as they establish their rep outside of the law. Between races, players can customize their rides and compete in weekly qualifiers to get into the ultimate street racing contest: The Grand. Mickey unleashes his paint brush in promo art for Epic Mickey: Rebrushed.Epic Mickey was a Wii exclusive upon its 2010 debut until THQ Nordic's 2024 remaster, Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, brought the game to modern consoles. The visuals and gameplay have been noticeably improved as Mickey Mouse is sucked into the Wasteland where forgotten characters and concepts have languished for decades. This game is one of the reasons why Disney made a deal to gain the rights to Walt Disney's previous creation, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. And for the first time, Mickey has to come face-to-face with his brother, Oswald, and reconcile with him if he wants any chance of escaping the Wasteland. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

As of December 31, Amazon's incredible deal on the SanDisk P9 256GB microSD Express is still available. Normally $55, the SanDisk P9 256GB is on sale for only $33. This deal has been available for about two weeks, so it probably won't be active for much longer. The $33 price is an all-time low for a microSD Express Card from any brand. The 512GB edition, unfortunately, is selling for its full $100 price. Amazon is also still selling the Lexar Play Pro 1TB microSD Express, the most popular 1TB card on the market, for $186 (was $220). For a 512GB card from Amazon, the Lexar Play Pro and Samsung P9 are your best bets at $100. Take a deeper dive into the world of microSD Express Cards for Nintendo Switch 2 below.
