    "title": "Leaked Underwear Homer Would Be First Fortnite Skin With Nipples",
    "description": "Fortnite's Simpsons season is apparently about to become a landmark for Epic Games' metaverse for reasons nobody could have expected--by reportedly offering the first shirtless character sporting visible nipples. The skin in question is an additional version of Homer Simpson, separate from the one in the battle pass, who's wearing nothing but his tighty whities. First look at New (Giant) Homer Skin! pic.twitter.com/LI2ibt7SfM — Dr Cacahuette - FN Leaks (@DrCacahuette) November 19, 2025 The discussion about Fortnite skins lacking nipples goes back to 2019, when a gigantic, shirtless and nipple-less digital version of Travis Scott performed a concert in Battle Royale. Since then we've gotten plenty of other shirtless guys as skins--but none have had nipples. It's not really that hard to figure out why that's been the norm, though, since Fortnite's art style is not realistic or detailed enough for nipples to be anything other than weird. But with Homer, who's cel-shaded and not very detailed, they can draw a couple circles on his chest that don't look upsetting the way that more detailed nipples on, say, the Mr. Savage skin probably would. This mostly-naked version of Homer Simpsons is reportedly going to be an item shop skin.Meanwhile, Homer in his underwear is a topic because this week's update added some loading screens, like the one above, that indicate pretty clearly we'll be facing off against a Giant Homer before the season ends--likely controlled by a player, similar to the Megazord and Godzilla events earlier this year. That this Giant Homer will also be a skin sold in the item shop is just a rumor for the moment, and it's possible that the model that has been datamined is merely the giant one that will roam the Battle Royale island.

    "title": "Black Ops 7's Nuketown 2025 Map Goes Live Tomorrow, See It In Action Now",
    "description": "Once again, Activision has reimagined one of Call of Duty's most iconic maps, Nuketown, and it's launching on November 20 for Black Ops 7. Now, Activision has released a new trailer dedicated to the map, which shows off its new look. The new version is called Nuketown 2025, and as you can see in the trailer, the map appears to be based on the same Nuketown 2025 from Black Ops 2. This makes sense as Black Ops 7 is a sequel to Black Ops 2. Whereas the original version of Nuketown from 2010's Black Ops was based on a '50s theme, this newest iteration has a \"retro-futuristic\" vibe that imagines what people thought the \"neighborhood of the future\" could look like. A key gameplay difference for Nuketown 2025 in Black Ops 7 is that the game features wall-jumping, which affords players new ways to get around the map. Nuketown is a small-size map known for its fast and frenetic action, and with wall-jumping now in play, things might get even more hectic. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Eventually, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said, this partnership will allow \"all Unity games\" to be published within Fortnite. That means even games that weren't designed for Fortnite should work, and this move could pave the way for Epic to fully incorporate Fall Guys into Fortnite. \"Starting next year, Unity developers will be able to publish games directly into Fortnite to appear in Fortnite’s discovery system alongside games built with Unreal Engine and to participate in the Fortnite economy as it evolves towards an open metaverse economy connecting all users and all engines,\" Sweeney said Wednesday at Unity's Unite conference. This is major news for developers, who will be able to make things for Fortnite without using Epic's tools and may be able to import their existing games into Fortnite as well. And with the recent news that Epic will allow Creative maps to sell things for V-Bucks, these Unity devs might actually be able to sell their games in Fortnite. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "It's the most wonderful time of the year for Fortnite players who like free stuff. While Epic regularly offers free in-game items for completing quests or leveling up, the company tends to really ramp up its charitable giving toward the end of the year--and our first truly free skin of the season is Cuddle Team Rider, which you can earn as part of the Winter Rush event, which runs through the end of the season on November 29. The Cuddle Team Rider skin is free for those who complete nine of Fortnite's Winter Rush quests.This event is basically the same thing as previous \"Rush\" events. Each day, you'll have two new quests that require you to gain 80,000 XP (exactly one account level) in specific types of Fortnite experiences while in a party with at least one friend. Each quest completed unlocks one cosmetic, starting with the jam track Acelerada by MXZI--the Cuddle Team Rider skin will unlock once you've completed nine (9) of them. The other free rewards include an animated wrap, an emote, and a back bling and pickaxe that match Cuddle Team Rider. The quests alternate between making you play Epic-developed experiences and trying out various types of Fortnite Creative maps. On the first day, the two quests we have are to gain XP in Festival or Rocket Racing, and gain XP in Tycoon creator-made islands. The rest of the quests aren't yet available, but you can expect to find new ones each day. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

An NBC Los Angeles report corroborates TMZ, stating that an LAPD officer with direct knowledge of the investigation said Burke has been uncooperative with the investigation and that he likely had help with dismembering and disposing of Rivas' body this past spring.

The patch notes mostly detailed fixes for the game's campaign and Zombies mode, but stability improvements were included for multiplayer. The developer addressed a campaign issue that allowed some events to lose their progress when players left the activity area. Unfortunately, the patch notes didn't specify if this is for the campaign's Endgame mode or the objectives found in the actual campaign missions. However, it did mention a fix for an issue that previously caused players to get stuck on a black screen specifically when loading into Endgame. For Zombies, the update fixed the Equivalent Exchange augment for the Quick-Revive perk. Treyarch said the augment wasn't reviving downed players after dealing enough damage as intended, but it should be working properly now. It also corrected a visual bug that allowed Aether Shroud's afterimage to exist longer than intended. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
