    "description": "This may be the winter of discontent for some Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 players. Activision has been notably quiet about the game's sales, and has yet to share metrics or statistics. There's also been an uptick in anger from fans over conspiracy issues related to the game's Skill-Based Matchmaking mode. That's led Charlie Olson--the creator of CoD's SBMM--to directly address some of those concerns himself. OIson--who spent a decade at Raven Software under Activision--shared a lengthy video on his YouTube channel that dives into how his SBMM is supposed to work. He also took the time to explain why Activision's announcement about bringing \"open matchmaking\" to Black Ops 7 didn't mean the game was dropping SBMM. If fans were expecting the chance to cut down inexperienced or casual players, they've been disappointed. Olson argues that it means the game has been dominated by \"sweats,\" or experienced players, rather than rookie players. \"Some players are leaving because they thought this tweet meant SBMM had been completely removed from the game, and then they felt betrayed by the inclusion of one standard matchmaking playlist, and then blamed it for stealing 'fodder' from the open playlist,\" explained Olson. \"What's really going on here is there aren't enough casual players at launch to make open matchmaking the pubstomp that was expected or promise. If open lobbies are sweaty, it's because it's mostly sweats playing.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

His memorable commentary on the game became part of NBA Jam's blockbuster success in arcades. However, Kitzrow has revealed that he was paid a very small amount for his work in the first game. While speaking with The Escapist, Kitzrow disclosed that he was paid $50 an hour for his work on NBA Jam, which was the same amount of money he made recording lines for Bally Midway's pinball machines. It wasn't until after the game was released that Kitzrow realized that he should have charged more. \"I'd go in, do a couple of sessions, maybe 15 hours total, and that was it,\" recalled Kitzrow. \"I wasn't smart enough, savvy enough to know the business, to go, 'Gee, these games make a lot of money, maybe I should make more than $50 an hour.' I didn't have an agent at the time ... When the game came out and I found out it made a billion dollars, that's when I realized I'd made like $800 and change ... I thought, 'Well, I'm probably being underpaid, I might want to raise my rate.'\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 received a small update on November 25, and the patch notes revealed a much-needed fix for the campaign's Endgame mode. The update added a new protection for disconnects that previously caused players to lose all of their progress in the mode. Black Ops 7's Endgame works much like the high-risk/high-reward structure of extraction-style shooters. Players grind matches of Endgame to level up their characters' abilities and combat rating, and failing to successfully extract from the map means they lose everything. Unfortunately, players were losing everything to random disconnects and game crashes as well. Treyarch said it heard the feedback from players, and the new update adds a disconnect protection. Now when players drop into matches of Endgame, the game snapshots the player's Combat Rating at the start of the match. This means players will keep their progress that was snapshotted at the start of the match even if a disconnect or crash occurs. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "TimeSplitters Rewind, a remake of sorts of the original TimeSplitters trilogy, is now available completely for free on PC and with the official blessing of the IP holder. TimeSplitters, TimeSplitters 2, and TimeSplitters: Future Perfect were a trio of well-liked FPS titles created in the early 2000s by UK developer Free Radical. The developer was working on TimeSplitters 4 when it went bankrupt in 2008 and was later absorbed by Crysis developer Crytek. A few years later in 2013, Crytek gave its official blessing to a TimeSplitters fan project looking to keep the franchise alive, even going so far as to provide original TimeSplitters assets for the project. The IP would later be transferred to THQ Nordic (now part of the Embracer Group), which honored Crytek's original agreement for the fan project, even as it briefly resurrected Free Radical with the intent on bringing the TimeSplitters franchise back to life.

    "description": "Apple AirPods 4 $69 (was $129) See at Amazon See at Walmart Apple AirPods 4 with ANC $100 (was $179) See at Amazon Apple AirPods 4 are on sale for all-time low prices for Black Friday at Amazon and Walmart. You can snag the entry-level AirPods 4 for just $69, which is $60 off the regular $129 price. If you want to add active noise cancellation to your new earbuds, the AirPods 4 with ANC are on sale for $80 off, dropping the price to only $100 while supplies last. The $69 AirPods 4 have already sold out multiple times at Amazon, but both models are in stock as of November 25 at 9:30 AM PT. Apple AirPods 4 $69 (was $129) The AirPods 4 feature a slightly revised form factor that makes for a more secure fit in your ears, improved sound quality thanks to revised acoustic architecture, and a new charging case with a USB-C port. The AirPods 4 run for up to five hours on a full charge, and the charging case brings that figure to 30 hours. With Apple's H2 chip, iPhones running on iOS 18 can take advantage of numerous high-end features, including Adaptive Audio and Conversation Awareness modes. See at Amazon See at Walmart Apple AirPods 4 with ANC $100 (was $179) If you like the new design of the AirPods but want active noise cancellation, the AirPods 4 with ANC are on sale for $100 (was $179). The $79 discount is the best deal yet for Apple's newest pair of highly rated earbuds with noise-canceling tech. The AirPods 4 with ANC can run up to four hours on a full charge when using ANC.

The ANC-enabled model also has a couple of other advanced features not found on the base model. The case includes wireless charging as well as USB-C wired charging. The base model only supports wired charging. The charging case also has a built-in speaker. See at Amazon Apple AirPods Pro 3 $219 (was $249) The new AirPods Pro 3 aren't on sale for nearly as big of a discount, but it's worth mentioning them here since these are Apple's only in-ear model being produced today. Released in September, the AirPods Pro 3 offer numerous improvements to core features as well as fancy new ones. With Apple AI, the AirPods Pro 3 translate other languages in real time. It also has an integrated heart rate sensor to monitor workouts and record health data. Apple also improved the 3D spatial audio, hearing aid functionality, and active noise-canceling tech. These buds are two times more effective than the Pro 2 and four times more effective than the original model at blocking outside noise. See at Amazon Apple AirPods Max $430 (was $549) Amazon has the AirPods Max in Midnight, Starlight, Orange, Purple, and Blue on sale for $430 (was $549).
