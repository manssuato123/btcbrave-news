    "description": "The dream of Skyblivion goes back over a decade as a team of fans came together to use The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's engine to fully recreate and re-imagine Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion as a modern RPG. At the beginning of 2023, the team set a 2025 premiere for Skyblivion. However, that's no longer the plan and Skyblivion has been pushed to next year. The good news is that the latest dev video shows off how much has been finished and what remains to be done. Skyblivion lead Rebelzize narrates the video as he offers a guide to where things stand. According to Rebelzize, most of the work has already been done and over 70 volunteer contributors are still hard at work trying to get the ambitious mod across the finish line. When this project was started, The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion was far out of date. Earlier this year, Bethesda released Oblivion Remastered, which could have taken the wind out of this team's project. Instead, Rebelzize and others praised the remaster as a \"win-win\" for the community. In recognition for their work, Bethesda gave copies of Oblivion Remastered to the entire Skyblivion mod team.

The Samsung P9 512GB microSD Express Card for Nintendo Switch 2 is on sale for $75 (was $100). This is marked as a limited-time deal, but it's unclear when the price will climb back to $100. But if you're looking for a deal on a 1TB Express, you're in luck: The Silicon Power 1TB microSD Express is available for $154 (was $220) when you click the coupon box on Amazon's store page. The 512GB edition is also 30% off, but Amazon's stock is running low. These are the lowest prices we've seen at Amazon for 512GB and 1TB Express Cards.

This promotion could end at any time, but as of December 3 at 12 PM PT, the Switch 2 with Mario Kart World is available for $449 (was $500) at Amazon and Walmart. Best Buy has increased the price back to $500, and Target sold out on Cyber Monday. Discounts on Nintendo consoles are rare in general, but it's genuinely shocking to see a deal on the Switch 2 less than six months after launch. The $51 discount will show up after you add the bundle to your cart at Walmart. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle $449 (was $500) The Mario Kart World console bundle is valued at $530, so you're essentially getting a copy of the Switch 2 exclusive for free. The bundle includes a voucher that can be redeemed on the Switch 2 eShop for the digital edition of Mario Kart World. Here's what's included inside the box: Switch 2 with 7.9-inch LCD display Joy-Con 2: Left and Right Joy-Con 2 Straps Joy-Con 2 Grip Dock for TV Mode Ultra High-Speed HDMI Cable USB-C Cable 60W AC adapter Voucher for Mario Kart World The Mario Kart bundle is selling for the same price as the Switch 2 console on its own. Nintendo previously stated the Mario Kart bundle would only be available until Fall 2025, so Amazon and Walmart might be clearing out their remaining units before the bundle disappears for good. See at Amazon See at Walmart The Switch 2 has 256GB of onboard storage, but you can expand it with a microSD Express Card.

Gilbert worked alongside two other people--an artist and a designer--for about a year on the project before Gilbert realized it was not going to happen. \"I just [didn't] have the money or the time to build a big open-world game like that,\" he said. \"You know, it's either a passion project you spent 10 years on, or you just need a bunch of money to be able to hire people and resources.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Getting 100% completion in a Metroid game--and metroidvania titles in general--is a satisfying achievement that's part of the genre's appeal. However, in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, there is unfortunately a way to pigeonhole yourself where collecting everything needed isn't possible. Now, the game will warn you about a point of no return, but it's still easy to make a regrettable decision. That's why GameSpot's reviewer for the first-person adventure, Steve Watts, advises players to make a copy of their main save in another save slot before entering the endgame. Watts detailed the \"confusing choice\" that Nintendo and developer Retro Studios made in his Metroid Prime 4 review. \"When I was ready to proceed to the endgame, I got the usual warnings about a point of no return, but I had figured I could always load an older save to go back and do more exploring to pick up power-ups that I missed,\" Watts wrote. \"But the auto-save now has me locked into the final area with no such apparent option, and my regular save slot--the one that activates when Samus steps into a save station--has been overwritten with a Mission Complete, so loading it prompts me to start a new game.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",
