Preorders for the It: Welcome to Derry Limited Edition Steelbook initially sold out in hours, but it's back in stock at Amazon for $45 and Walmart for $57. If you're a Stephen King fan, it'd probably be wise to preorder ASAP. Steelbook Editions of the two-part It film adaptation sold out fast, and Welcome to Derry is the first TV series based on a Stephen King novel to get a 4K Blu-ray edition. At this time, the Limited Edition Steelbook is the only way to get the series on 4K Blu-ray. Welcome to Derry: Season 1 is available to stream in full on HBO Max. Alternatively, you can buy Season 1 on other streaming platforms like Amazon Prime Video for $22. Welcome to Derry holds an 80% on Rotten Tomatoes, and I think many longtime fans of King's legendary horror novel would say Season 1 was pretty great. HBO has yet to renew the series for a second season, but director Andy Muschietti has a three-season arc in mind. Season 1 tells the story of Pennywise's reign of terror in 1962. Season 2 would rewind the clock 27 years to Pennywise's previous feeding cycle in 1935, and Season 3 would be set in 1908. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Available for $61.74 (was $80), it lets you build a functional replica of the fun coin pushing games found at the arcade. This is the first real discount we've seen for the product, and it looks like a neat project to work on over the holidays. Sosuy Motorized Coin Pusher Arcade Game Building Set (2,093 pieces) $61.74 (was $80) While kids will have fun playing with the Coin Pusher Arcade Game once the build is complete, they'll probably need an adult to help snap together its 2,093 pieces. Not only are there a lot of pieces, but the kit features a bunch of moving parts that likely require a skilled hand to get working properly. For example, the finished game features a movable coin slot, a rotatable switch, and an electric motor drive. In other words, parents can have fun constructing the complex machine alongside their kids, making it a cool winter activity for the whole family. Once the building is done, the machine comes with everything you need to start playing like you're at the arcade, including dozens of durable plastic coins. See at Amazon The completed machine stands nearly 17 inches tall and 11 inches wide, making it a pretty robust project. It looks quite premium, too, with a retro yellow-and-red design and a little \"Coin\" marquee at the top by the coin slot. While the brand, Sosuy, doesn't have the name recognition of Lego, it's responsible for some unique building kits. Beyond this game, it sells a Bumper Cars Building Set featuring movable vehicles. It's also on sale ahead of the holidays, now just $48.44 (was $60) at Amazon. And though it's not discounted, the Water Slide Building Set offers a colorful design, a slidable track, a functioning chain to move its passengers, and spans nearly two feet when completed.

    "description": "Mad Max 5-Film Collection (4K Blu-ray) $49.49 (was $80) See at Amazon Nothing beats finding a freshly wrapped 4K Blu-ray box set under the Christmas tree, and if you're looking to spoil someone who enjoys \"Ozsploitation\" movies, then check out this limited-time deal on the entire Mad Max film saga. This 4K Blu-ray bundle launched for $100 last year, but it's now discounted to its lowest price yet at $49.49 on Amazon. It also comes with digital copies of all five movies. This is an awesome deal on one of the most acclaimed action film series, but the price cut ends until 11:59 PM PT, so you only have a few more hours to take advantage of the deal. Mad Max 5-Film Collection (4K Blu-ray) $49.49 (was $80) Set in a dystopian future where society has broken down in the wake of resource and water wars, the box set includes Mad Max, Mad Max: The Road Warrior, Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, Mad Max: Fury Road, and Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga. The slipcase also pays tribute to the film series, featuring artwork showcasing various images of the bandits and the vehicles that hunted down Max and Furiosa throughout each movie. This collection includes a curated selection of special features pulled from previous Blu-ray releases. You can sit down for several behind-the-scenes documentaries, deleted scenes, and featurettes that explore the chaotic world of the film series. What makes this edition special is that it is the only 4K Blu-ray box set to include the physical Black &amp; Chrome editions of Fury Road and Furiosa. Both movies look stunning in black and white, as each film was re-graded to create striking images bereft of color. The only downside to this collection is that there are no special features included for Beyond Thunderdome. Mad Max fans will be used to this, since no bonus materials were included on the original DVD or on standard Blu-ray copies of the film.

The Totally Awesome '80s bundle is available for $55, and it includes Top Gun, Trading Places, The Untouchables, Beverly Hills Cop, and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Considered among the greatest blockbusters of that decade, each film also comes with a digital streaming copy and special features.

    "description": "Earlier this year, Silent Hill f became the first game in the series to ditch the small American town that the series was named for in favor of setting it in Japan decades earlier. That approach may be used again for future titles in the franchise, according to developer Motoi Okamoto. \"We believe we could perhaps take similar approaches with other cultures across the globe,\" Okamoto told Inverse through a translator. \"For example, in Central or South America, we could perhaps tap into the more local, shamanistic beliefs and see how that ties in. But we could also try to expand our horizons and look into other regions, like possibly Russia, Italy, or South Korea, because all those areas have their own unique types of belief systems. I believe that will be a gateway for us to expand our concepts further.\" Okamoto appears to have put the most thought into the Central and South American locations, which he said have \"been affected by a lot of military governments and coups,\" before adding, \"There is a type of bravado and 'machismo' that comes from these political landscapes. There’s also the more folkloric angle coming from shamanism and local beliefs.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",
