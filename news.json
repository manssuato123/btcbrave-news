As an encore, Team Cherry has confirmed that there will be DLC released for Silksong. Just don't expect it too soon. \"I don't really know what else people would necessarily want to hear other than what we're already saying,\" Team Cherry co-founder Ari Gibson told Bloomberg. \"Yes, we're continuing to work on the game, we're pursuing the things that excite us ... I think what people might want to hear is: There will be new stuff coming in a reasonable timeframe and not seven years from now.\" Gibson went on to explain that he and Team Cherry co-founder William Pellen \"might have some vague ideas\" for the DLC, but added that he didn't want to \"overpromise\" and underdeliver to the game's fans.

    "description": "Battlefield Studios has released an update on Battlefield 6's anticheat, now that we're one month into the popular shooter's first season. The statistics look highly impressive for the studio's campaign against cheaters, claiming that only 2% of total matches were likely to have been impacted by cheating. Instead of reporting on anticheat by the number of cheaters caught or banned, Battlefield Studios uses a metric it calls \"Match Infection Rate,\" or MIR, calculated around the likelihood that at least one cheater impacted the results of a given match. The studio reports a MIR of just 2% in the week following launch, which means an impressive 98% of matches were cheat-free. In the month following BF6's launch, the MIR has fluctuated a little, but has stayed mostly between 2% and 3%. The studio reports that EA's Javelin Anticheat has blocked more then 2.39 million cheat attempts to date since release--comparably less than the open beta, which saw over 1.2 million cheats blocked in under 10 days.

During the recent Zero Hour finale, Fortnite brought together Superman, Ironman, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the Power Rangers, Invincible, Street Fighter's Chun Li, Mortal Kombat's Scorpion and Sub Zero, and even a giant Homer Simpson for the final battle. Now, Epic Games co-founder Mark Rein is taking a bow and explaining how he helped make it happen. Superman, Iron Man, Invincible, Homer, Godzilla, Optimus Prime, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the Power Rangers, Sub Zero, Scorpion &amp; more team up in an ‘Avengers: Endgame’ style sequence in Fortnite. pic.twitter.com/wROpgDJgdg — DiscussingFilm (@DiscussingFilm) November 29, 2025 In a post on X, Rein noted that he negotiated the deals that brought these characters into Fortnite and acknowledged his \"great legal team.\" But he attributed the willingness to let the crossover happen to the Fortnite developers for winning the trust of the studios. \"It was mostly the vision of our design and development team combined with bravery of our partners that made this all possible,\" wrote Rein. \"Imagine the audacity of what we were asking them to do with their beloved and sacred intellectual property and the trust that required in us! Yet they all came on board and cooperate in ways that continue to delight millions of people every day. We have truly amazing partners and in many ways we're still just getting started!!\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Everstone Studios' free-to-play action-adventure-RPG Where Winds Meet is a game that gives over many of its NPC conversations to chatbots. But these NPCs aren't necessarily smarter because they're AI. In fact, players have discovered some easy-to-exploit loopholes in the chat model that convinces NPCs to hand over their side-quest loot or money even when you haven't done anything at all. Players on Reddit noticed that the AI-powered chatbot NPCs often put their emotional responses and actions in parentheses. That led to the discovery that telling an NPC that you did something to fulfill their quest inside of a parentheses will cause the NPC to believe you've already done it. And the game rewards players for that deception by having the NPC hand over whatever item they promised the player for their help. At first, I tried to speak normally to the chatbots, but then I realized you have the power of (divine truth) byu/Proximis inWhereWindsMeet While Everstone may eventually fix that workaround, it's not the only way to mislead the NPCs. Another user on Reddit found that repeating the NPC's last statement as a question can eventually wear it down until it hands over the item. The user called it, \"the Metal Gear method.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Lemay-Comtois went on to explain that while there will still be post-launch content for Shadows, \"It's not a full-on DLC the way a season pass would have had in the previous years ... Any content we want to do in Year Two will probably be more sparse, not a drip-feed... but chunkier updates that shake things up a little more. I'm not announcing anything at this point, but our strategy for Year One was to be quick and reactive, so it means smaller drops often, but for Year Two we don't need to put fires out or anything, so it's more what good, chunky little piece of meat... we can drop and have people come back and enjoy it.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Seagate 2TB Xbox Expansion Card $184.76 (was $260) See at Amazon If you picked up some of the great Xbox game deals in Amazon's Black Friday sale, you should also check out the retailer's Cyber Monday deals on high-capacity Seagate Storage Expansion Cards. The 2TB Seagate Expansion Card is discounted to $184.76 (was $260), and the 4TB model is down to $380 (was $500). These are the lowest prices ever offered by Amazon for either edition. Seagate 2TB Xbox Expansion Card $184.76 (was $260) Seagate's Expansion Card is also available in a 1TB edition. This one isn't an official Cyber Monday deal, but it is discounted to $121.19 (was $160). 1TB -- $121.19 ($160) 2TB -- $184.76 ($260) 4TB -- $380 ($500) Seagate's Expansion Card is one of two officially licensed storage upgrade options for Xbox Series X|S. Western Digital makes the other one, but the WD Black C50 isn't available for as low of prices right now. The C50 512GB is $80, the 1TB is $135 (was $150), and the 2TB is $216.19 (was $230). The 1TB model was $100 during Amazon's early Black Friday sale. If you subscribe to Xbox Game Pass, you've probably noticed how fast those hundreds of usable gigabytes can be claimed by games. and updates. This is especially true if you download AAA games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, The Outer Worlds 2, and Ninja Gaiden 4, to name a few recent releases. See at Amazon Seagate's Expansion Cards used to be incredibly expensive, but the arrival of the C50 led to price drops. Seagate and Western Digital Xbox Expansion Cards offer the same functionality. You simply insert the proprietary storage card into the expansion slot on the back of your console. Your Xbox will recognize the card and allow you to choose if you want to use internal storage or expansion storage as your primary install location. That's the whole installation process; these truly are plug-and-play storage solutions. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

We've seen some terrific Lego promotions over the past few weeks, including Star Wars models for 50% off, Batmobiles for all-time low prices, Formula 1 and Fast &amp; Furious race car deals, and rare price cuts on Lego Icons models like the awesome Pac-Man Arcade. There are still some fantastic Lego deals available, but there's no guarantee any of them will be available after today (December 1). We've rounded up the best Cyber Monday Lego deals available now. Cyber Monday Lego Deals: Amazon | Walmart | Target | Lego Store | Best Buy Not every Lego deal is explicitly marked as a Cyber Monday deal. This happens most often when Amazon matches a deal from a competitor. As such, Amazon's store page for Lego deals is missing a lot of great offers, so the lists below look different than Amazon's official Cyber Monday Lego hub.

    "description": "Fortnite Chapter 7 has totally revamped the Battle Royale loot pool in the new season, and the new arsenal is mostly made up of weapons we've never had before. Likewise, Epic has added a few new types of items that have no real precedent in Fortnite, and some of them are exceptionally powerful. But for this story, the biggest new addition is the boss kits, which drop when you defeat an NPC boss. These kits are locked in your inventory until you win the round or die, make you look like the boss the kit came from, and give you increased health and stamina, and an ability unique to that boss that you have to activate manually by using the item. Oh, and it shows everyone on the map exactly where you are. There are three of these bosses at the moment, and they rotate randomly between five locations: Ripped Tides, Classified Canyon, Painted Palms, and either side of the lake east of Wonkeeland. Without any further ado, let's see what we're working with in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, from the deadly new weapons to the awesome new Self-Revive Kit. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Sony UBP-X700U 4K Blu-ray Player (2025 model) $218 (was $300) Get deal at Amazon Get deal at Best Buy If you're interested in adding a dedicated 4K Blu-ray player to your home theater, check out Amazon's deal on the Sony UBP-X700U before it disappears. Released earlier this year with a $300 price tag, the entry-level Sony 4K Blu-ray player is on sale for only $218 for Cyber Monday. The $82 discount matches the deals we saw during Prime Day and Big Deal Days. Sony UBP-X700U 4K Blu-ray Player (2025 model) $218 (was $300) Sony Blu-ray players have a solid reputation, and the X700U model on sale offers a number of features found in some of Sony's high-end line of Blu-ray players. It plays 4K Blu-rays in native 4K UHD (2160p) resolution and supports HDR10, which improves picture brightness. It comes with an HDMI cable, but we'd recommend grabbing a second 4K cable if you don't have a spare. That's because the player has two HDMI out ports. The main one is for video and audio, and is the only one you must use, but the second output is dedicated to audio. Separating audio from video output produces a richer, clearer sound, so dual ports are common on dedicated 4K Blu-ray players. It's one of the benefits of using a media player for Blu-rays instead of a game console like the PS5 or Xbox Series X. You can grab an Amazon Basics 4K HDMI cable for less than $5 right now. The UBP-X700U also has a Coaxial SPDIF, which can be connected to speakers, soundbars, and TVs. In terms of audio support, the UBP-X700U is equipped with high-end audio enhancements, including Dolby Atmos and DTS:X. One of the coolest features of dedicated Blu-ray players like the X700U is picture upscaling. The X700U can read 4K Blu-ray, standard Blu-ray, and DVDs. When enabled, the built-in tech will enhance the resolution of standard Blu-rays and DVDs. While we haven't tested the 2025 edition of the X700U, the upscaling feature on previous iterations was quite impressive. Standard 1080p Blu-rays can look pretty darn close to 4K resolution, and 480p resolution DVDs are substantially better. Honestly, without upscaling tech, DVDs generally look terrible on modern 4K and HD panels. That said, upscaled output varies, and sometimes there are jagged edges or noticeable oddities that won't be appealing to viewers looking for an authentic experience. Get deal at Amazon Get deal at Best Buy Naturally, if you buy a new 4K Blu-ray player, you should probably pick up some shiny new 4K UHD discs, too. Amazon's Cyber Monday sale features a wide assortment of movies on 4K Blu-ray for steep discounts. You should also check out the Criterion Collection holiday sale, which runs until December 7 and includes classics and contemporary hits for 50% off. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
