These limited-time offerings aim to give fans a preview of what awaits in the expansion, in an edible form. The highlight of the promotion is a pair of striking new donuts, currently referred to only as the Red Donut and Blue Donut--names chosen to avoid spoilers before launch. Despite the intentionally vague labels, their designs unmistakably resemble Groudon and Kyogre, the legendary Pokemon featured on the covers of Pokemon Ruby and Pokemon Sapphire. The official website even playfully teases their origins with the line: \"They look like some kind of Pokemon…?\", suggesting that these real-world treats may hint at major Legendary appearances within the DLC itself. Image Credit: Pikachu SweetsThe Red Donut will have a strawberry and tea Flavor, with the Blue Donut having a banana and lemon flavor. Both cost 550 yen. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Fan Theories Link Pokemon Pokopia To Older Games In The Franchise",
    "description": "When it was announced in September 2025, Pokemon Pokopia appeared to be the franchise's cozy-game answer to Animal Crossing and Minecraft. But after the recently released extended trailer for the game, fans have pointed out intriguing and dark links to some of the previous titles in the franchise. It's almost unsettling that one of the first things seen in the extended trailer is a devastated Pokemon Center and a generation-one Pokedex. As noted on Reddit (via Eurogamer), one of the fan theories suggests that Pokopia is set on Cinnabar Island from the Kanto region, which was originally featured in Pokemon Blue, Red, and Yellow. As depicted in Pokemon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, Cinnabar Island was devastated by a volcano eruption that left a Pokemon Center as one of the last remaining structures, much like the one glimpsed in Pokopia's trailer. Professor Tangrowth--a character introduced in the trailer--mentions that he hasn't seen humans in a long time, but the island has other evidence that people once lived there including roads and other buildings. The strange Pokemon variations introduced in the trailer--like the stark-white Pikachu known as Peakychu--may have been created at Cinnabar Island's Pokemon Mansion. Perhaps not coincidentally, Pokemon Mansion was the place where Ditto could be found in the original Pokemon games. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "A harmless prophecy turned into confusion about whether Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet would show up at The Game Awards next month. But the Naughty Dog title reportedly won't be seen at the show. Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb confirmed that Intergalactic won't appear at The Game Awards in December. Additionally, Grubb also stated on X that Intergalactic isn't coming out in 2026. These details were discovered after a weird sort of telephone game played out on the internet, starting with a prediction about Intergalactic by Colin Moriarty, the Last Stand Media owner, who later addressed the situation on X over the weekend. Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet - Trailer, Story, Setting, And Everything Else We Know See More Earlier this year, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier also reported that Intergalatic's earliest release window is 2027. The next game from The Last of Us developer was unveiled at The Game Awards last year. Naughty Dog stated that work began on Intergalactic in 2020. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Internet (And Gaming) Icon Strong Bad Returns With New Email After Three Years",
    "description": "After three years of mysteriously absent email-checking, Strong Bad has finally smashed his boxing-gloved fists onto the keyboard once more, returning with a brand-new message for his loyal fans. And in true Strong Bad fashion, it's about robots--again--and this time they apparently want to discuss their favorite sauces. His comeback feels like stepping back into Free Country, USA itself: chaotic, ridiculous, and somehow still deeply important to a generation. It also offers the perfect opportunity to revisit the era when Strong Bad and the rest of the Homestar Runner cast broke out of browser windows and into full-fledged video games. The most defining gaming moment for the franchise came with the Telltale game Strong Bad’s Cool Game for Attractive People, a five-episode point-and-click adventure released throughout 2008. The game played like an interactive Homestar Runner cartoon, built in close collaboration with the Brothers Chaps, who supplied writing, design input, and voice work. Guiding Strong Bad through his latest harebrained schemes--from band competitions to clumsy attempts at political takeover--gave fans a new way to revel in the character's larger-than-life personality, all while exploring familiar territory like the House of Strong and Bubs' Concession Stand. A large part of the game's charm came from its faithfulness to the original Flash cartoons. While it followed Telltale's traditional adventure formula, the world was loaded with oddball interactions, surreal conversations, and puzzles that functioned less on logic and more on the internal rules of Homestar Runner's absurdity. Each episode came packed with extra features, such as bizarre arcade minigames, collectible Teen Girl Squad cards, and hidden Easter eggs that rewarded longtime fans who had practically memorized the old website.
