There's another possible reason why this Cyber Monday deal has returned at major retailers. According to an internal GameStop memo shared by Nintendeal, the bundle is no longer in production. This isn't a surprise, as Nintendo originally stated the bundle would only be available until Fall 2025.

The industry average for profit margins is likely between 17% and 22%, analysts said in the Bloomberg piece.

In light of Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from its nomination.\" Following that decision, The Indie Game Awards named Blue Prince as its new Game of the Year.

Discovery to acquire the media and entertainment behemoth, Paramount has not given up on its own attempt to acquire the company by going directly to shareholders. Now, Paramount has announced that it has further sweetened its proposal in a bid to make a deal. Paramount, which is run by David Ellison, has offered an \"irrevocable personal guarantee\" from his father, billionaire Oracle founder Larry Ellison, of $40.4 billion. Additionally, Paramount announced that it would increase and match Netflix's fee of $5.8 billion to be paid to WBD if the deal gets struck down in the regulatory process. Paramount's previous breakup fee was $5 billion. What's more, Paramount said its revised proposal includes \"further improved flexibility to WBD on debt refinancing transactions, representations, and interim operating covenants.\" The updated offer also includes the publishing of records that show the Ellison family trust owns 1.16 billion shares of Oracle stock, which is an attempt to show WBD shareholders that the Ellisons can indeed finance their $40.4 billion of the proposed $108 billion all-cash offer.

The 2028 date was revealed during publisher Snail Games' Investor Day held at the NASDAQ Marketsite building in Times Square this week (via the Epic Games Store blog), and the studio also unveiled a new look at the in-game model of Bob, the character who has appeared in multiple Ark projects and is voiced by The Boys star Karl Urban. Studio co-founder Jeremy Stieglitz revealed a two-year roadmap for Ark: Survival Ascended, which will culminate with the release of Legacy of Santiago, a major expansion that will lay the groundwork for Ark 2 and introduce several new gameplay mechanics coming to the sequel.
