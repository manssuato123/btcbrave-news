The Federal Trade Commission said Amazon must pay $1 billion in a civil penalty and $1.5 billion in refunds to consumers. Also as part of the settlement, Amazon must agree to \"cease unlawful enrollment and cancellation practices for Prime.\" It takes Amazon about 13 hours to make $1 billion, so the penalty isn't likely to hurt the company financially, but the FTC touted the precedent that's being set here.

This has been one of the most popular 4K Blu-ray box sets at Amazon since its reveal in July. It launched September 30 with a $105 MSRP, but Amazon's Black Friday deal slashes the price to $84.39. You're paying roughly 12 bucks per movie, which is a bargain--especially since six of the Elm Street films are only available on 4K Blu-ray in this collection. If you want to watch Freddy Krueger's slashing sprees in 4K UHD resolution, we'd recommend snagging this deal soon. It's prominently featured on Amazon's Black Friday Blu-ray page, so it could sell out before the promotion expires. A Nightmare on Elm Street: 7-Film Collection (4K Blu-ray) $84.39 (was $105) | Black Friday Deal A Nightmare on Elm Street's new collection comes with 4K Blu-ray and Movies Anywhere digital editions of the following movies: A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984): Theatrical &amp; Uncut versions Freddy's Revenge (1985) Dream Warriors (1987) The Dream Master (1988) The Dream Child (1989): Theatrical &amp; Uncut versions Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994) The first Elm Street movie received a standalone 4K Blu-ray release last fall--Amazon recently restocked the Limited Edition Steelbook--but the other six made their 4K debut in this collection. The original series technically ends with 1991's The Final Nightmare, but the set includes the satirical 1994 film, Wes Craven's New Nightmare, in which Freddy is a fictional villain from a popular movie franchise. All seven movies in the collection are presented in native 4K (2160p) resolution with support for HDR10. On the audio side, the collection offers Dolby Atmos, Dolby TrueHD 7.1, and DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0. Inside the box, you'll find a pair of 3D glasses, which can be used for certain parts in Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare. As for bonus on-disc content, the uncut versions of the original and The Dream Child are included alongside all of the special features from the standard Blu-ray editions of each film. Two new featurettes are included on the last disc: Freddy's Footnotes and Boiler Room Confessional. It's worth noting that the bonus features are presented in 1080p resolution and do not support HDR. See at Amazon A Nightmare on Elm Street: 7-Film Collection (Blu-ray) $18 (was $60) Alternatively, you can pick up all seven films in a standard Blu-ray box set for cheap. A Nightmare on Elm Street's 7-Film Collection on 1080p Blu-ray is an absolute steal at $18. This box set comes with four Blu-ray discs and a bonus DVD with hours of bonus content. The Blu-ray discs are also jam-packed with featurettes, commentaries, interviews, and other behind-the-scenes content. Outside of the aforementioned pair of featurettes and the 3D glasses, the Blu-ray collection has all of the extras found in the 4K box set. All seven films display in 1080p resolution and have DTS-HD surround sound and Dolby Digital Mono audio tracks. The first movie has DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 surround sound, while the other six have Master Audio 5.1. In addition to the two English sound options, mono audio tracks are also available in French, German, and Italian. The first movie gets its own disc, but the other three Blu-ray discs contain two movies each. You're already getting hours of special features on the Blu-rays, so this bargain is even better when you consider the bonus DVD has over three hours of extras, too. It includes the 2012 documentary about Freddy Krueger called Fear Itself, two episodes of the television anthology series Freddy's Nightmare, and two featurettes. Fans should also check out this Blu-ray Triple Feature for $12, as it includes the 2010 reimagining of Elm Street, Freddy vs. Jason, and Friday the 13th's 2009 reboot. For more Michael Myers, check out the fresh reprint of Friday the 13th 8-Movie Steelbook Collection for only $23 (was $38) before it's gone. The DVD box set and the complete TV series are also available for cheap. Friday the 13th: 8-Movie Steelbook Collection (Blu-ray) -- $23 ($38) Friday the 13th: Ultimate 8-Movie Collection (DVD) -- $14 ($23) Friday the 13th: The Complete Series (DVD) -- $29.71 ($40) See at Amazon Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Treyarch has released its first post-launch Dev Talk video to reveal some major changes the studio is preparing for the launch of Season 1 next month. This discusses the community feedback regarding Black Ops 7's aim-assist, weapon balancing, and more. Black Ops 7's assault rifles feel really powerful in multiplayer, while most of the guns in the submachine class have struggled to feel viable. Treyarch associate design director Matt Scronce confirms that a buff is coming across the entire submachine gun class. Scronce says no plans are made for adjustments to the marksman rifles or snipers, but the team is monitoring the data. \"The overall goal with those weapons in Black Ops 7 is that they are a bit more present without being too dominant,\" Scronce says.

Let's take a look at everything you'll need to do to get this quest wrapped up.

What is Roadside Research? Few things in life are certain, but I feel confident in saying you probably won't guess the hook for this game. What even is Roadside Research? Roadside Research is a 1-4 player co-op gas station simulator. Simulator-type games are everywhere these days, but this one differentiates itself because you play as an alien. More specifically, you're an undercover alien who tries to act like a human and do human-like things that a gas station attendant would do like stocking shelves and assisting customers. \"Just don't get caught,\" reads a line from the description. All the while, players are trying to gather intelligence on humans in preparation for an upcoming alien invasion. \"If you arouse too much suspicion, the government will show up, jeopardizing your Earthly mission,\" the description adds.

The first Bounty Pack, How Rush Saved Mercenary Day, is now available on consoles and PC. As the title implies, this is Borderlands' version of a Christmas story as filtered through the lens of the game. The DLC allows players to team up with the leader of the Outbounders, Rush, for some holiday cheer by giving \"the miserly Minister Screw\" a proverbial kick in the butt. The DLC comes alongside new gear and cosmetics, as well as some fresh missions. Gearbox also explained why this update was released for free. \"As a holiday-themed Bounty Pack, it was important that players receive it by the end of the year,\" wrote a Gearbox rep. \"However, with the continued efforts to improve the Borderlands 4 experience, the team ran out of time to stuff as much mayhem-fueled content into the Bounty Pack 1 stocking as originally planned.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Poncle's Luca Galante told GameSpot that he originally wanted to launch Vampire Crawlers in 2025, but this proved unrealistic after the studio decided to add more deckbuilding elements. Adding this feature pushed the release of Vampire Crawlers to 2026, which is also when GTA 6 is launching. Rockstar's highly anticipated open-world game debuts on November 19, 2026, and for now, Galante is \"not 100% sure\" when he wants to bring Vampire Crawlers to market.
