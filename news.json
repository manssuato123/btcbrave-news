The Federal Trade Commission said Amazon must pay $1 billion in a civil penalty and $1.5 billion in refunds to consumers. Also as part of the settlement, Amazon must agree to \"cease unlawful enrollment and cancellation practices for Prime.\" It takes Amazon about 13 hours to make $1 billion, so the penalty isn't likely to hurt the company financially, but the FTC touted the precedent that's being set here.

    "description": "A Nightmare on Elm Street: 7-Film Collection (4K Blu-ray) $84.39 (was $105) | Black Friday Deal See at Amazon A Nightmare on Elm Street: 7-Film Collection (Blu-ray) $18 (was $60) See at Amazon A Nightmare on Elm Street's recently released 7-Film 4K Blu-ray Collection is on sale for its best price yet for Black Friday at Amazon. This has been one of the most popular 4K Blu-ray box sets at Amazon since its reveal in July. It launched September 30 with a $105 MSRP, but Amazon's Black Friday deal slashes the price to $84.39. You're paying roughly 12 bucks per movie, which is a bargain--especially since six of the Elm Street films are only available on 4K Blu-ray in this collection. If you want to watch Freddy Krueger's slashing sprees in 4K UHD resolution, we'd recommend snagging this deal soon. It's prominently featured on Amazon's Black Friday Blu-ray page, so it could sell out before the promotion expires. A Nightmare on Elm Street: 7-Film Collection (4K Blu-ray) $84.39 (was $105) | Black Friday Deal A Nightmare on Elm Street's new collection comes with 4K Blu-ray and Movies Anywhere digital editions of the following movies: A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984): Theatrical &amp; Uncut versions Freddy's Revenge (1985) Dream Warriors (1987) The Dream Master (1988) The Dream Child (1989): Theatrical &amp; Uncut versions Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994) The first Elm Street movie received a standalone 4K Blu-ray release last fall--Amazon recently restocked the Limited Edition Steelbook--but the other six made their 4K debut in this collection. The original series technically ends with 1991's The Final Nightmare, but the set includes the satirical 1994 film, Wes Craven's New Nightmare, in which Freddy is a fictional villain from a popular movie franchise. All seven movies in the collection are presented in native 4K (2160p) resolution with support for HDR10. On the audio side, the collection offers Dolby Atmos, Dolby TrueHD 7.1, and DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0. Inside the box, you'll find a pair of 3D glasses, which can be used for certain parts in Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare. As for bonus on-disc content, the uncut versions of the original and The Dream Child are included alongside all of the special features from the standard Blu-ray editions of each film. Two new featurettes are included on the last disc: Freddy's Footnotes and Boiler Room Confessional. It's worth noting that the bonus features are presented in 1080p resolution and do not support HDR. See at Amazon A Nightmare on Elm Street: 7-Film Collection (Blu-ray) $18 (was $60) Alternatively, you can pick up all seven films in a standard Blu-ray box set for cheap. A Nightmare on Elm Street's 7-Film Collection on 1080p Blu-ray is an absolute steal at $18. This box set comes with four Blu-ray discs and a bonus DVD with hours of bonus content. The Blu-ray discs are also jam-packed with featurettes, commentaries, interviews, and other behind-the-scenes content. Outside of the aforementioned pair of featurettes and the 3D glasses, the Blu-ray collection has all of the extras found in the 4K box set. All seven films display in 1080p resolution and have DTS-HD surround sound and Dolby Digital Mono audio tracks. The first movie has DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 surround sound, while the other six have Master Audio 5.1. In addition to the two English sound options, mono audio tracks are also available in French, German, and Italian. The first movie gets its own disc, but the other three Blu-ray discs contain two movies each. You're already getting hours of special features on the Blu-rays, so this bargain is even better when you consider the bonus DVD has over three hours of extras, too. It includes the 2012 documentary about Freddy Krueger called Fear Itself, two episodes of the television anthology series Freddy's Nightmare, and two featurettes. Fans should also check out this Blu-ray Triple Feature for $12, as it includes the 2010 reimagining of Elm Street, Freddy vs. Jason, and Friday the 13th's 2009 reboot. For more Michael Myers, check out the fresh reprint of Friday the 13th 8-Movie Steelbook Collection for only $23 (was $38) before it's gone. The DVD box set and the complete TV series are also available for cheap. Friday the 13th: 8-Movie Steelbook Collection (Blu-ray) -- $23 ($38) Friday the 13th: Ultimate 8-Movie Collection (DVD) -- $14 ($23) Friday the 13th: The Complete Series (DVD) -- $29.71 ($40) See at Amazon Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Treyarch has released its first post-launch Dev Talk video to reveal some major changes the studio is preparing for the launch of Season 1 next month. This discusses the community feedback regarding Black Ops 7's aim-assist, weapon balancing, and more. Black Ops 7's assault rifles feel really powerful in multiplayer, while most of the guns in the submachine class have struggled to feel viable. Treyarch associate design director Matt Scronce confirms that a buff is coming across the entire submachine gun class. Scronce says no plans are made for adjustments to the marksman rifles or snipers, but the team is monitoring the data. \"The overall goal with those weapons in Black Ops 7 is that they are a bit more present without being too dominant,\" Scronce says.

Let's take a look at everything you'll need to do to get this quest wrapped up.

What is Roadside Research? Few things in life are certain, but I feel confident in saying you probably won't guess the hook for this game. What even is Roadside Research? Roadside Research is a 1-4 player co-op gas station simulator. Simulator-type games are everywhere these days, but this one differentiates itself because you play as an alien. More specifically, you're an undercover alien who tries to act like a human and do human-like things that a gas station attendant would do like stocking shelves and assisting customers. \"Just don't get caught,\" reads a line from the description. All the while, players are trying to gather intelligence on humans in preparation for an upcoming alien invasion. \"If you arouse too much suspicion, the government will show up, jeopardizing your Earthly mission,\" the description adds.

The first Bounty Pack, How Rush Saved Mercenary Day, is now available on consoles and PC. As the title implies, this is Borderlands' version of a Christmas story as filtered through the lens of the game. The DLC allows players to team up with the leader of the Outbounders, Rush, for some holiday cheer by giving \"the miserly Minister Screw\" a proverbial kick in the butt. The DLC comes alongside new gear and cosmetics, as well as some fresh missions. Gearbox also explained why this update was released for free. \"As a holiday-themed Bounty Pack, it was important that players receive it by the end of the year,\" wrote a Gearbox rep. \"However, with the continued efforts to improve the Borderlands 4 experience, the team ran out of time to stuff as much mayhem-fueled content into the Bounty Pack 1 stocking as originally planned.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Adding this feature pushed the release of Vampire Crawlers to 2026, which is also when GTA 6 is launching. Rockstar's highly anticipated open-world game debuts on November 19, 2026, and for now, Galante is \"not 100% sure\" when he wants to bring Vampire Crawlers to market.

We worked with several indie teams, experimenting a little bit, and what happened is simply that Vampire Crawlers was the game that immediately jumped out at us,\" he explained. \"From the initial prototype, the team just nailed it.

When you had a flat tire, or you couldn’t get a cab at the airport the night before. When you’re physically exhausted and wrung out, you’re more present in the interview. You don’t care as much. You aren’t pent up and nervous and mewly. The thing to remember before your job interview is that you’re going to do beautifully. You’re going to meet a new person — what’s the big deal about that? There’s nothing to it. If they don’t want to hire you, God bless them. You don’t need them. You are perfect in yourself. When you get that and believe it, your job interviews will get a lot easier. Oh for God’s sake Liz, did you ever have to pay a mortgage? Did you ever have a car payment past due? Yes my darling, I understand that fear. I’m telling you that approaching the interview with the attitude “Oh God, let me get this job!” can only hurt you. You want the job? Then you have to go in there and make it clear that you’ll take the job if it’s a fit for you and you’ll walk away from it if it isn’t. If you radiate the energy “Please hire me, I beg you!” only a terribly fearful manager will hire you. The manager who will hire you in that state is someone who wants his or her new employee to be grateful for the job even if comes with emotional abuse threaded through it. That kind of manager can’t help you grow your flame — he or she can only squash it. You have to believe in yourself before anyone else will. For thousands of years our species has valued courage. We talk about it incessantly. Courage is treating every job interview the same way whether the rent money is in the bank or not. You send out energy waves. Do you doubt it? Think of pheromones. There are confidence-mones, too. Dogs smell fear, and people are no different. When you go into a job interview ready to grovel and beg and roll over and play fetch, you’re toast. You have no credibility then. Your goal on a job interview is not to please anyone. Your job is to bring yourself to the meeting, completely. Only the people who get you, deserve you. The night before your job interview, lay out your clothes down to the pocket square if you’re bringing one. I mean your exact shoes, socks, underwear, shirt, tie, dress or whatever you’re wearing. If you’re wearing pantyhose to the interview, get them out. Try them on. Don’t take any chances. You don’t need one extra thing to think about on the interview day. Make a test drive or bus or train ride before the interview. Don’t take a chance that the address on the building is obscured by scaffolding or there’s a detour on the way. Go to the building and make sure you know where the entrance is. Check on the parking situation. Get all that logistical stuff out of the way. On the night before, make a list of questions. You’ve got brilliant interview questions prepared, right? You must. Research the employer up and down on their own website and LinkedIn. Think about the hiring manager’s pain. Why is he or she filling this job? It’s not because it’s fun to hire people. Few people would say that it is. It’s nerve-wracking. They’re hiring someone because there are important things that can’t happen in the business until this person comes on board and gets things moving. That could be you! In the morning, go to work if you’ve got a lunchtime or after-work interview. Otherwise, meditate and exercise. Listen to music. Clear everything out of your mind. You can do a little of this even at work if you get a quiet moment. Listen to your favorite song on your headphones. Here are 100 of my favorites to choose from. Get out your padfolio with a notepad and pen inside it. Write your questions on the notepad. Tuck several of your job search business cards and a few extra copies of your Human-Voiced Resume into the padfolio, and if you’re printing driving directions, do that now. If you can possibly exercise in some way before the interview, do it! Better to be exhausted than overly tight. Loosen up. Run up and down the stairs a few times if nothing else. My daughter is a 21-year-old operatic mezzo and I tell her to do ten minutes of brisk exercise before every audition. Jumping jacks are perfect, because you can do those in a small space. Wear yourself out. That’s the best way to quiet your anxious brain and relax so you can be in the moment in your interview. The common and awful habit of a job-seeker in an interview is to anticipate the interviewer’s every question and try to compose perfect Teacher’s Pet answers while the interviewer is still talking. In case you forgot, it’s extremely obvious when your conversation partner has mentally departed the room. Your perfect answer — if there could ever be such a thing — is not what the interviewer is looking for. The real you in the chair is a thousand times more important. Managers forget job candidates all the time.ROB: So Liz, you sent me this form to evaluate Janice Allen as a possible lab tech. LIZ: Yes. What did you think of Janice for your job opening? ROB: Honestly… LIZ: Yes? ROB: Which one was she again? LIZ: Sort of auburn hair.. ROB: What’s auburn again? LIZ: Kind of a brownish-red. Chestnut.ROB: Not really a hair-color guy. LIZ: She has Cairn terriers — like Toto in “The Wizard of Oz.” ROB: Didn’t see it. LIZ: WHAT!? I’m speechless. ROB: For reals. LIZ: Did you see “Mary Poppins?” ROB: That one I saw. LIZ: So Janice — she worked at Motorola.ROB: Half the people we interview worked at Motorola. LIZ: Geez. She was a lab tech there. She worked on base station diagnostics. ROB: Nothing. Not even a ripple. LIZ: Here, let me show you her LinkedIn profile. ROB: Wow! Even with the profile, I’m not getting a reading. LIZ: And I brought her into your office. It was a busy day. This scene plays out in offices around the world, every day. Your hiring manager is busy and distracted. Then, they fall into the script and it’s a rote conversation. You have to change that energy. You’re not going to do that by answering the interviewer’s questions like a Good Little Sheepie interview. You have to step outside that frame completely. That means telling the truth in a job interview, rather than trying to give the interviewer the answer you think s/he’s looking for. It means spinning the table to ask questions yourself rather than sitting quietly like a person getting a citizenship exam, just waiting for the next question.Be real in the interview, thank the interviewer for his or her time, get up, and go home. Stop and get yourself a nice gelato on the way. You deserve it! Now the interview is over. Exercise or meditate some more. You are amazing. Everything that you said and did at the interview was exactly perfect. It was what was supposed to happen today. Don’t beat yourself up or second-guess your conversation, but do capture your notes and ideas about the interview before you go to bed. Call your wisest bestie and run down the interview with him or her, leaving out no details. Our friends are great at asking questions that need to be asked and making astute observations. The interview today gave you great learning. You won’t even know how much learning you got from it for months or years. It’s not important what the next step is or whether you continue in this hiring pipeline or not. You did your best. If you got ideas for your next interview, fantastic! You are growing new muscles. You are getting stronger all the time!",

    "title": "What Every Job-Seeker Needs To Know About Headhunters",
    "description": "Before you decide “I need to meet a headhunter who’ll find me a new job” you need to understand how the third-party search business works. Employers pay third-party recruiters, sometimes called search consultants or headhunters, when they don’t think they can fill a job opening on their own. Sometimes they try to fill the position on their own and they can’t find anyone they want to hire, so they get their search partners involved. It is important to remember that recruiters work for their clients, the way all consultants do. They don’t work for the job candidates they collaborate with, although job candidates are naturally a critical piece of the puzzle for search consultants. Still, the employer pays the bills. This is why job-seekers are often disappointed when recruiters they meet aren’t always thrilled to give the job-seekers tons of free career coaching. It’s not that recruiters are stingy with their advice, or uncaring. It’s just that there are lots of job-seekers to help, and recruiters don’t get paid when they aren’t placing people into new jobs. Some recruiters are difficult, of course. Some of them are terse and some are mean. It’s that way in any profession. I’m an HR person. Do you think I’m going to sit here and try to tell you that every HR person is a warm, compassionate and wise evangelist for employees? Attorneys get slammed as rapacious sharks, used-car salespeople get tagged as hucksters. Every field and career path has great people in it, and other people who struggle to show their human qualities. It will always be that way. Still, people judge recruiters unfairly, because to make it as a recruiter you have to have a lot more than a phone number and a stream of jive. You have to understand what a client is telling you they need when they can’t articulate it themselves. You have to deal with client needs that can change dramatically overnight — even in the middle of a search! — and candidates who flake out, who tell you they’re excited about the job and then don’t show up for the interview, or who tell you at the last minute before the job offer comes “I think I might start my own business, instead.”There are two ways to be a third-party recruiter. You can work by yourself or in a firm with other people doing contingency search. If you’re a contingency recruiter, you don’t get paid unless your candidate accepts the job offer. You get a commission when that happens, equivalent to about 25% of the new hire’s first year cash compensation. What does it mean to only get paid when your candidate takes the offer? It means you may be competing with a bunch of other recruiters who also have candidates applying for the same job. It means staying on top of the hiring manager without irritating the manager so badly that s/he stops returning your calls — even if you were promised feedback on a candidate by last Friday afternoon, and it’s now four days later. There is a lot of finesse in recruiting. The other way to recruit is to work for a retained search firm, or become a retained search consultant and work solo. Retained search people are hired by the employer to fill certain positions, often high-level jobs that pay upwards of USD $10oK per year in salary. When you’re hired to conduct a retained search, you’re hired — you’re not competing with any other recruiters or search firms at that point. You still have to hustle to bring in candidates the employer will love. When one of those candidates is hired, the search assignment is completed. When we occasionally conduct searches for our clients at Human Workplace, this is the kind of recruiting we do. When you get a call at work or at home from a recruiter about a job opportunity, your excitement may impel you to say “Sure! I’ll send my resume right now! Where should I send it?” That’s not a good idea. The recruiter could be anybody. S/he could work for a top-notch firm or be a highly credible independent recruiter, or s/he could be a slimetastic wannabe who misuses your resume and damages your brand.Let’s say the headhunter who calls you is in the latter category. Let’s call our fictional recruiter Lola. Lola calls you at your desk one day when you’re working. She says, “Wow! I’m glad I got you. I have a fantastic opportunity at Angry Chocolates, and you’re perfect for it!” You get all excited. You fire off a resume to Lola, and the next thing you know, Lola sends the resume to the HR VP at Angry Chocolates and says “You should interview my candidate, who is perfect for your position!” The only problem is that Lola started her search business last week when she got sick of her job as the front-desk receptionist at a nail salon across town. God bless Lola’s pluck — a pain-in-the-neck mani/pedi customer demanded that Lola go outside in the freezing rain and hail the customer a cab, to save the customer from having it to it herself. Lola told the customer where to go in her cab when she found one, and walked off the job. Lola decided to become a search consultant because the barriers to entry in that field are nonexistent. Anybody can become a recruiter, which is one of the things that artificially tarnishes the third-party recruiting community’s brand through no fault of their own. Lola already had a phone. She uses her gmail account to recruit from, and she’s in business. Geez! thinks Lola. That was easy. Now I need to get a search assignment, but wait! I have no experience and no credibility as a headhunter. I know! I’ll find some job ads, and send the HR people behind those jobs ads really good candidate resumes. Where will I get the resumes? I’ll call unsuspecting working people at their desks and tell them I already have the search assignment — yeah! That’s the ticket. Then I’ll get great resumes, send them to the client and maybe I’ll actually get the search assignment for real. No one knows who Lola is. She’s never headhunted before, or networked, but her nails look amazing. She starts calling candidates. Not one of the eager candidates asks Lola “How long have you been in search?” or “How many people did you place into Angry Chocolates last year?” They should have asked those questions! Now Lola has ten resumes and she’s lobbing new resumes into Angry Chocolates all the time. The HR VP gets annoyed at all the unsolicited email she’s getting from Lola. “Some of these resumes look okay,” says the HR VP to the manager of the hiring department, “but who is this Lola? She has no track record, I’ve never heard of her and I can’t even find a LinkedIn profile.”“Too bad for those candidates,” says the hiring manager. The candidates never had a clue that their association with Lola was tanking their chances at an interview. If a legit recruiter calls them a week later, gets their resume and sends it into Angry Chocolates, the second recruiter may be told “We can’t interview that candidate, qualified as s/he seems to be. We already received that resume last week from Lola Somebody-or-Other.” The second recruiter may be able to place you into the job and get paid a commission if the employer is willing to go out on a limb with Lola and say “We are not going to pay your commission because we had no relationship with you, and no agreement in place, when you sent us that resume before.” That being said, a lot of employers wouldn’t take that chance. They’d pass on you because they’d be squeamish about getting in the middle of a two-recruiter time-stamp dispute. Don’t give your resume to strangers, no matter who they say they know! Ask a lot of questions. Anybody who tells you “I have to have your resume tonight!” is full of baloney. Remember the old workstation-poster, usually photocopied at a crooked angle on the page, passed around from hand to hand? It said “A lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part.” A recruiter in your corner is a blessing and a huge career asset, if your search partner is credible and wise. Lots of recruiters are. Accept no substitutes!",

    "title": "SIHH 2015: Introducing the Exceptional A. Lange &amp; Sohne Saxonia Automatik",
    "description": "It’s January and every watch geek knows what that means. Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie, more commonly referred to as SIHH, has arrived! Amongst the exhibitors at this grandiose affair are Cartier, Piaget, Vacheron Constantin, A. Lange &amp; Sohne, and a plethora of other Richemont brands and independent watchmaking houses. When it comes to ultra-luxury watches, I tend to prefer the simpler designs, such as the new Saxonia Automatik by A. Lange &amp; Sohne. Just the thought of a 38.5 millimeter dress watch, for quite some time, I considered gauche. But since seeing Lange’s reinvented Saxonia Automatik, not only has my outlook on relatively large timepieces changed, but I’d be down to wear this watch any day. Its brilliant pink gold case is home to the splendid manufacture calibre L086.1 self-winding movement. As Lange’s 50th in-house caliber, this movement marks a milestone in the company’s great history as Germany’s foremost watch manufacture. I must add, never have I witnessed a finer finishing on any other automatic movement, and Lange’s creative use of German Silver is definitely something to laud. As expected, a power reserve of 72 hours and many components–209, to be exact. What I admire most about this piece is the elegant, simplistic solid silver dial. Oversized would be an understatement, but surely the dial is nothing flashy. If there was a perfectly-balanced dress watch, one that you can wear (almost) anywhere, the A. Lange &amp; Sohne Saxonia Automatik would be it. For further information, please visit www.alange-soehne.com.

    "title": "Winemakers At The Vatican: Politics, Publicity, And The Influence Of Pope Francis",
    "description": "ROME – Early yesterday morning, on a bus parked outside the gold-tipped fence of the Hotel Cavaliere, a cadre of Italian sommeliers made their preparations. They adjusted their uniforms, white button-down shirts contrasting with black pants, jacket, and apron. They tucked in here and tied up there, straightening ties, smoothing fabric, adjusting the chains and tastevin cups around their necks. There was a charge of excited energy in the air, as the sommeliers were joined on the bus by some of the Italian wine world’s most recognizable faces, from winemakers to management to journalists. At the appointed time, two more bus loads just like this one – carrying about 150 people in all – made their way to Vatican City, winding through the streets of Rome as dawn broke and the sun rose over the city. Wine as Religious Metaphor The delegation was on its way to an audience with Pope Francis, Jorge Mario Bergoglio, to represent Italian wine. The Pope’s family roots in the Piedmont wine region, before his grandparents immigrated to Argentina, are well-documented. He also uses wine as a metaphor in his teachings. On one occasion, for example, he compared the heart to a fine wine, saying that “a heart that isn’t luminous is like bad wine: with time it spoils and becomes vinegar.” On another occasion he said that the elderly are like a “fine vintage wine” with the “power to give us this noble inheritance.” So it was logical for the Italian wine delegation, initiated and organized by Franco Ricci of the Fondazione Italiana Sommelier as well as the Italian wine guide Bibenda, to request an audience with the Pope. General audiences, which take place in Paul VI Hall on most Wednesday mornings throughout the year, include representatives from religious and business organizations around the world. Marco Caprai, from the Arnaldo Caprai winery in Umbria, was one of the winemakers in yesterday’s delegation; this was his third papal audience, and for an earlier visit he was part of a group representing agricultural interests. How Can the Pope Help the Wine Industry? The idea of winemakers visiting the Vatican may have been logical and in keeping with the tradition of the General audiences. Yet, for me, it was a curious initiative as well. I wondered what, exactly, the group thinks that the Pope can do for Italian wine? Why did they come, and what did they hope would come from the event? These were the questions I asked throughout the morning yesterday, to different members of the group as we made our way from the Hotel Cavaliere to the bus to the Paul VI Hall. Their answers reflected a range of opinions. These three bottles of wine, made from Sangiovese, Syrah, and Merlot grapes, were part of a gift from the FONDAZIONE to the Pope on the occasion of the group’s visit to the Vatican yesterday. Photo Credit: Cathy Huyghe For some, it wasn’t at all about asking the Pope to do anything. It was about honoring the office of the Pope and this Pope in particular. “It’s important to separate the business of wine from the religion here,” said Angelo Gaja from Barbaresco, as we joined the stream of people walking to the entrance of Paul VI Hall. “I’m here to pay respect to this Pope,” he said, clearly enjoying his first papal audience, as well as the opportunity to see so many colleagues gathered together at once. Others pointed to the importance of a cohesive Italian wine industry at this particular moment in time. “I think it’s important for us to be united,” said Nadia Zenato of the Zenato and Sansonina estates near Verona. “It’s important to recognize the producers and our passion for the territory and our families.” Others mentioned the opportunity for this time away from the work of the industry. “We are all together because of the same passion,” said Carlo Guerrieri Gonzaga of Tenuta San Leonardo in Trentino. “And it’s nice to have a moment where we are not thinking only of the wine. The important thing is to have a moment where all the world of wine is hearing the message of this Pope.” Still others saw it as a missed opportunity. “It would have been a good idea to speak between ourselves, in a guided way, about the meaning of wine at this moment in the world,” said Florence-based journalist and sommelier Andrea Gori. “It was a good occasion wasted, because it’s not easy to bring all of these people together.” And still others saw it simply as a PR event or, put another way, as an opportunity to bring attention to Italian wine and specifically to the culture of wine in Italy. That was the motivation of Franco Ricci, who requested the audience on behalf of the Fondazione Italiana Sommelier. If the Pope Pays Attention, Everyone Pays Attention The common thread of the responses from the winemakers and sommeliers was their recognizing the relationship between Italian wine and the position or endorsement of the Vatican in Italian life. If Papa Francesco pays attention, everyone pays attention.Attention, according to Ricci, is exactly what the Italian wine industry needs, in the form of marketing and communication about wine, particularly at a time when domestic consumption is decreasing and essential knowledge and appreciation of wine is lacking, especially among younger generations. “It’s not easy to communicate the quality of Italian wine because it’s not easy to communicate about the land and the producers,” Ricci said. “There are maybe 10 million Italians who know wine. There are 51 million who never will.” At the most basic level, the first steps need to happen within the government, he said. Even Italian school children can be taught to taste, starting with things like milk and olive oil. “This could be a good start, to lay the foundation of wine culture in this country,” said Paola Simonetti, Bibenda wine editor. Petitioning for the help of government support is one path forward. Another path leads back to this Pope. Giovanni Mantovani, CEO of Veronafiere, said that he has been talking with Vatican representatives about organizing a smaller, more direct meeting with the Pope and representatives of Italian wine. Mantovani hopes that such a meeting can take place later this year. Cathy Huyghe writes about the business and politics of the wine industry.

    "title": "Three Things Every Job-Hunter Has To Prove",
    "description": "Sometimes when I listen to job-seekers talk about their resumes and their job-search approaches, I think they believe that a machine will be hiring them, rather than a person. The front of end of the typical corporate or institutional hiring process is automated. You know how I feel about those talent-repelling Applicant Tracking Systems if you read my columns. Still, that’s just the front of the process. The rest of the hiring pipeline is staffed by humans. Humans don’t hire people just because those people have the formal qualifications listed in the job ad. Humans hire other people because they believe in their guts — the most important part of the body when it comes to making hiring decisions — that a particular job-seeker knows what they’re up against and can jump in to help them sort it out. Job-seekers shoot themselves in the foot by forgetting why managers hire people in the first place. They hire people because they have to. Nobody ever hired a staff member just to spend money, or just to fill up an office that had some empty space in it. They hire people when that’s the best answer to a problem they’re experiencing. Maybe Sally retired last August, and Sally’s manager decided to hold off on replacing Sally. The manager tried to make it through without anyone in Sally’s position to see whether he could save money. It was an experiment worth trying, but it failed. It turns out that Sally’s job is essential to the department. As soon as Sally retired, everything started to fall apart. So now the manager is back out on the talent market. He’s placed a job ad and is waiting for responses from job-seekers. What is the manager looking for? He listed a bunch of job requirements in the job ad. He listed a bunch of essential job qualifications that he pulled out of — well, he made them up on the spot. How much does Sally’s ex-manager really care about the ‘essential job qualifications’ he listed in the job ad? He doesn’t care that much about any of them — he just needed some qualifications so that Robin, his HR person, would be able to screen resumes into a big pile of “no thanks” replies and a smaller pile of folks to interview.See how bureaucracy works? The process itself rules the day and the people who might make amazing new team members have to bow to the process. We call that The Tail Wagging the Dog. It’s very foolish, but very popular! The stack of incoming resumes will be screened in or out based on the qualifications listed in the job ad. After that, no one will talk about the formal requirements of the job anymore. When the manager starts conducting interviews, he’ll be looking for something more important than three years of this or a certification in that. He’ll be looking for the answer to his burning question “Who can come in here and fix what’s broken?” Much more important than decidedly non-essential and often random requirements in the job ad are these three criteria: Does the job applicant understand what the job is? Can he or she read between the lines in the job ad, research the employer and through that research and his or her exposure to the working world, form an opinion about what the job might entail and how one might thrive in it? To use Human Workplace language, does the job-seeker understand the Business Pain this new person is being hired to alleviate? Secondly, does the job-seeker have stories to share – stories that demonstrate the job-seeker’s understanding of the problem(s) he or she is being hired to solve? Your stories are far more powerful than your job titles, statistics and years of experience. Can you explain how you’ll make a contribution in your new job, without waiting for a hiring manager to ask you “Why should we hire you?” Lastly, does the job-seeker have the confidence to see him- or herself as a person with choices — a person who doesn’t have to grovel and beg for a job, and wouldn’t do that even if someone wanted him or her to? Managers hire people who have choices. No one wants to hire the most grovelly job-seeker in the bunch, the one who’s willing to crawl over multiple piles of broken glass to get a job. Just because a manager asks hard questions in a job interview or challenges the job-seeker on his or her knowledge doesn’t mean that the manager doesn’t like the applicant. The manager may be asking hard questions because s/he’s seriously thinking about hiring you. They want to know if you’re up for the challenge. Often we think that the purpose of a job interview is to mewl and beg for a job, but no one respects a person who doesn’t respect himself. If you know you can do the job, then you’ll be ready to ask tough questions about Business Pain and bring your whole self to a job interview. Despite what you may think, Sheepie Job Seekers who tell managers “I can be anything you want me to be!” don’t get hired first. They get hired last, if at all. When you have a problem — a dented fender or a leaky pipe, for instance — who do you call to fix it? Do you call the person who says “I’m a plumber and I need work! I’ll do anything you want! You name the price!” or a person you know can do the job well, either because you’ve used that plumber before or because of his or her great reputation? When you have a problem, you hire the person you trust to get the job done. It’s the same in the talent marketplace. Managers hire people they trust to solve their problems — like the problem where Sally retired and it turned out that the company couldn’t run without her. That manager isn’t trying to hire the person who has no self-esteem, and who makes it clear that s/he’s willing to do anything, be anyone and work for peanuts. The manager will hire the person who knows what he or she brings and can prove it.We always have the choice to accept a job offer or reject it. Even if the rent is due, we have a choice. The only way you’ll grow your muscles as a job-seeker and as a working person is to use them, even when it’s scary, out on the edge. The faster you learn to walk away from the wrong opportunities, the faster the right ones will come in. In the meantime, ask yourself: Can I read between the lines in this job ad to see the pain my possible next boss is up against? Can I show through my Dragon-Slaying Stories that I’ve solved this type of pain before, even if it wasn’t in my job title? and Am I ready to walk away from this opportunity if these folks don’t get me?",

    "title": "Real Estate Entrepreneur Joins Ranks Of Chinese Billionaires",
    "description": "A more than 75% gain in the past year in the share price of real estate industry entrepreneur Chen Jinsong’s Shenzhen Worldunion Properties has turned him into China’s newest billionaire. Chen, 51, with his wife Tong Jie holds 47% of Worldunion. The stake was worth 6.7 billion yuan, or $1.1 billion at yesterday’s closing price of 18.92 yuan. Tong isn’t involved in the business. China has been one of the world’s fastest-growing sources of new billionaires in the past decade. The 2014 Forbes China Rich List published last October had a record 242 billionaires, second only to the United States. The list was led by China e-commerce leader Alibaba Group’s Jack Ma. Worldunion said this week it expects net profit for last year to increase by up to 30% from $51 million in 2013, in part owing to acquisitions. The company announced plans last year to sell a 10% stake to U.S.-listed online real estate information provider SouFun Holdings for $120 million in a private placement that hasn’t been completed. SouFun’s shares have dropped nearly two-thirds in the past year on rough competition for advertising. Chen, Worldunion’s chairman, ranked No. 342 on the 2014 Forbes China Rich List with wealth of $760 million. Worldunion listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in 2009. –With Maggie Chen– Follow me on Twitter @rflannerychina",

    "title": "Escaping JFK Arrest, London's Mayor Boris Johnson Pays IRS &amp;nbsp;",
    "description": "Say it ain’t so, Boris? Tax protesters everywhere were hoping that the hopping-mad London Mayor and accidental dual U.K.-U.S. citizen Boris Johnson would stick to his guns and refuse to pay the IRS. The political tax brouhaha started when the New York born brit (who left America at age 5) said he couldn’t be taxable by the IRS as he gave up U.S. citizenship. Then it turned out he hadn’t, as the BBC confirmed, despite his threats to renounce in a column for the Spectator. Then there was outrage over American’s unique but expansive worldwide tax regime. The Mayor politely gave the IRS the finger, saying it was ‘outrageous’ for the IRS to tax people all over the world for an accident of birth. Meantime, FATCA—the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act—is causing panic around the world. Banks and nations everywhere are ratting out Americans to the IRS. No account anywhere is safe from the IRS’ prying eyes and FBAR penalties. (Image credit: Andrew Parsons) Up until now, the tousled blond mayor refused to pay the IRS, which must have felt good. But there was more than idle talk that he could face arrest on his next US. visit! So he paid his “absolutely outrageous” U.S. tax bill, escaping an embarrassing incident when he next visits America. U.S. law says all citizens, including dual citizens, must pay tax on worldwide income. And U.S. rules often trump others. U.K. tax law excluded Mr. Johnson’s London house, which he sold in 2009 for a reported £1.2 million. But in the U.S., there’s no such luck. Rather than quietly paying the IRS, in an NPR interview, Mr. Johnson called it ‘outrageous’ to tax U.S. citizens on their global income. Mr. Johnson noted that tax rates in the U.K. are higher than in the U.S. Still, the house sale was tax exempt in the U.K., so Mayor Boris can’t claim a credit for his U.K. taxes to the IRS. TO be fair, there was a tit for tat tax problem too. The Mayor has lambasted the U.S. Embassy in London for failing to pay London’s congestion tax. The Embassy says it is a tax and diplomats are immune! When President Obama was in the U.K. in 2011, Johnson reportedly asked him for a £5 million cheque for unpaid congestion charges but the U.S. Ambassador intervened before President Obama could answer. By last year, the amount the U.S. Embassy owed more than £7 million. The prospect of being hauled in by tax inspectors when Mr. Johnson touches down in Boston, New York or Washington in February must have changed his mind. Mr. Johnson has previously said he might renounce his U.S. citizenship. Yet most renunciations involve certifying that you are compliant with the IRS for the last 5 years. Renouncing isn’t easy and wouldn’t solve his tax bill. Apart from proving five years of U.S. tax compliance, you may have to pay an exit tax. Expats and disgruntled American taxpayers were happy that Mr. Johnson was calling attention to fairness. Many hoped citizenship-based taxation would be scrapped. Mr. Johnson got support from expats miffed with the American tax code and the IRS. After several Canadians filed suit to block FATCA in Canada, a named plaintiff wrote Mayor Boris offering her support. They all must feel let down that Mr. Johnson has paid the IRS bill and moved on. Lesson: the IRS wants money. The IRS collects, often because the threat of its reach is just too big. Even overseas. Even political figures. Everywhere.

    "title": "Super Bowl 49 For Dummies: From 'Inflategate' to Zebras Reviewing Half the Plays",
    "description": "Loving professional football as a fan and a former Raider writer–it was almost like covering an NFL team!–I worry that today’s jargon, and the reverent attitude toward the league, our royal family, have made Super Bowl week incomprehensible. Of course, the game has always been such a mystery, coaches used to say, “I won’t know until I see the film.” Then, after they saw the film, they still wouldn’t tell us. Now, of course, they just say, “We’re focusing on next week,” having learned it from in-group role model Bill Belichick of the Patriots. To help understand where we are and how things got this way… Inflategate–This season’s blockbuster: Patriots used under-inflated balls to edge Indianapolis, 45-7, galvanizing the press more than the Colts. Tweeted Indy tight end Dwayne Allen: “They could have played with soap for balls and beat us.” Not that people got carried away but a Boston Globe headline, described Belichick’s “Don’t ask me” response as “Belichick throws Tom Brady under the bus.” Happily for the Patriots, Brady didn’t seem to notice having been thrown under anything. Would you buy a deflated football from this man? (Associated Press photo) The story is expected to fade into history, as did other sensational ones like Bear QB Jim McMahon mooning a news helicopter in 1985–unless the NFL declares a forfeit and sends the Colts to the Super Bowl. Why NFL won’t declare a forfeit if Belichick is caught with inflating needles–And ruin this great Belichick/Brady/Patriots vs. defending champ Seattle story line? Why it couldn’t be an innocent mistake–The Patriots and Belichick are always pulling this crap, stealing signs, etc. Number of other NFL teams pulling this crap–29. Why These Bowls Are Super—That was the hot word in 1967 when they player Super Bowl I. Has been supplanted many times over, most recently by way cooler words or prefixes like “mega,” “iconic” and “uber,” if decades too late to give us an annual Uber-Bowl. Media Day—Press session on Monday of Super Bowl week. Became a mooing stampede decades ago such that in 1981 Oakland’s Jim Plunkett was asked, “Let me get this straight, Jim, is it blind mother, deaf father, or the other way around?” Now it’s a total geek-fest, waiting to be hijacked by media hot dogs like Mexican TV personality Ines Gomez Mont, who showed up in a wedding dress in 2008 and asked Tom Brady and Eli Manning to marry her. [embedded content] In a bigger joke, the NFL now sells tickets to the public. In a cautionary tale for our society, it sold out the entire lower deck of Phoenix University Stadium. Countdown to kickoff—The annual pre-game feature on TV and the stadium screen, which goes back to our nation’s founding, or the emergence of our species, and traces our history up to the start of today’s game. The Commissioner—A god-like figure who extracts the necessary billions from networks and fans, if it means expanding the schedule to 24 games, the playoffs to 28 teams and keeping the Rams in a permanent holding pattern between Los Angeles, Anaheim and St. Louis. Answers only to the occasional independent panel, which he convenes in case of emergency to exonerate him of responsibility. Otherwise, all The Commissioner has to worry about is Keith Olbermann, who will demand that he resign if he gets the hiccups, from wherever Keith works now. If Paul Tagliabue, the NFL lawyer who lost the Raider case, could become commissioner for 17 uneventful seasons, Roger Goodell should be able to survive Olbermann, et al. Key play—Color commentator’s term for the next play. Setting a standard that may live forever, NBC’s Al Derogatis, whom Sports Illustrated would name the best NFL commenator of all time, called the opening kickoff of Super Bowl IX a key play. Pittsburgh’s Preston Pearson returned it to his 37, but the Steelers then went three and out. With Pittsburgh ultimately beating Miami, 16-6, it didn’t turn out to mean that much. Nor would most of the plays that commenators have labeled “key” in the XXIX Super Bowls since.All-time great quarterback—What Brady is now. Once-great quarterback—What Brady was after the 41-14 loss in Kansas City Patriots’ Sept. 19m, which Belichick let backup Jimmy Garropolo finish, and got questions about who would start the following week. Game manager—Quarterback who can be trusted to throw many passes. What Seattle’s Russell Wilson is when the Seahawks lose. QB of the future—What Wilson is now after running for 849 yards during the season and getting the Seahawks to their second Super Bowl in his three seasons. Misunderstood, complex personality—Belichick, Richard Sherman and Marshawn Lynch who refuse to talk or won’t shut up, as long as they’re winning. Jerk—Belichick, Sherman and Lynch when they’re not winning. Happily for all, it hasn’t come up that often. Yards after contact—Hip NFL metric for yardage gained after being hit. Bad tackling—Hip defensive metric for yards allowed after hitting someone.Metric—Fancy name for what were once called statistics, which in today’s augmented state are now referred as “advanced statistics.”… Next: Uber-stats? Zebras–Refereeing crew Under review—Video review. What zebras do on every other play from scrimmage. Ed Hochuli—Highly-rated referee, known for demonstrative first-down signal that highlights his arms, bulked up from working out six hours a day. Defensive holding—Penalty clearly spelled out in the NFL rules, capable of being read by any player, if he’s also a lawyer. An eligible receiver is considered to be an obstructing opponent ONLY to a point five yards beyond the line of scrimmage unless the player who receives the snap clearly demonstrates no further intention to pass the ball. Within this five-yard zone, a defensive player may chuck an eligible player in front of him. A defensive player is allowed to maintain continuous and unbroken contact within the five-yard zone until a point when the receiver is even with the defender. The defensive player cannot use his hands or arms to push from behind, hang onto, or encircle an eligible receiver in a manner that restricts movement as the play develops. Beyond this five-yard limitation, a defender may use his hands or arms ONLY to defend or protect himself against impending contact caused by a receiver. In such reaction, the defender may not contact a receiver who attempts to take a path to evade him. Not that this explains why Walt Coleman’s crew called more than Gene Serratore’s, Ron Torbert’s and Jeff Triplette’s combined… unless Walt is a lawyer! Nope. Just looked it up. He runs a family dairy in Little Rock, Ark.. Starting the conversation—NFL term for launching ad campaign to correct the very problem it ignored, like the poignant “No More” spots after minimizing the Ray Rice incident. With the networks presumably donating the time, commercials feature football commentators like Chris Carter and Hollywood stars like Hilary Swank raise awareness so something like the Ray Rice incident can never be minimized again.",

    "title": "New Ruling: IRS Can Tax Payments To Egg Donors As Income",
    "description": "Among the many injustices life dishes out on a daily basis is the fact that many women who are actively trying to become pregnant cannot do so, while every teenager with more hormones and free time than common sense seemingly can’t keep from getting pregnant. It’s a struggle I witnessed up close and personal when my older sister tried unsuccessfully for years to conceive a child, her painful emotional battle reaching its nadir when an apathetic doctor explained to her that, “some women just aren’t meant to have children.” Fourteen years and three beautiful girls later, my sister got the last laugh. But the process was far from easy, which is the reality for many women. And this is precisely why the fertility industry has become a billion dollar business. There are no shortage of available alternatives for women struggling to get pregnant; unfortunately, they are typically intrusive and expensive. One option, which is the thrust of our discussion here, is “egg donation,” whereby a female donor is supplied with hormones that increase her egg production. The eggs are then removed, fertilized in a laboratory, and ultimately implanted in the intended recipient. The term “egg donation” is a bit of a misnomer, however, because rarely is the egg “donated” in the traditional, altruistic sense. Rather, the donor is typically compensated, and compensated well. This, as you might imagine, has led to a rather big tax conundrum: do the amounts received by the donor in exchange for her eggs constitute taxable income? The issue has been a huge topic of conversation on egg donor message boards (yes, there is such a thing) and in the fertility industry at large. And for good reason: because until today, there was no answer. Hours ago, however, that all changed, when the Tax Court concluded that amounts received by a donor represented taxable compensation income. What We Know About Egg Donation Donating eggs is a selective, painful, and yes, lucrative, process. While any woman can apply to be a donor, only nonsmokers between the ages of 21 and 30 who have no family history of cancer or personal history of infertility or mental disorders will even pass the initial screening. For those who are ultimately accepted, they are then subjected to a series of psychological and physical evaluations, including blood tests, pap smears, breast exams, and pregnancy tests. As they near the extraction date, donors endure a series of intrusive physical examinations and hormonal injections. The injections, which are routinely done directly into the donor’s stomach, leave burning and bruising behind. There is no disputing that the experience leaves the donor physically damaged and emotionally drained.Despite the prolonged, painful process, egg donation has been on the rise for young women for an obvious reason: it pays well. College newspapers and Craigslist are filled with offers to pay a qualifying donor as much $50,000 for her eggs; an amount that is too life-changing for many twenty-somethings to be ignored. What We Don’t Know About Egg Donation The tax consequences of dealing in the human body are largely unsettled, and they probably should be. As we’ll see at the end of this discussion, any precedent that establishes that a part of the body is property, or can be sold or donated, opens up a Pandora’s Box of potential abuse. As a result, the IRS and the courts have tread lightly in establishing such precedent. In fact, over 100 years of tax law reveals little more clarity about the tax consequences of dealing in in the human body than 1) breast milk is considered property, the donation of which may result in a charitable contribution, and 2) donating blood may be either the sale of property or the performance of a service, depending on the court. It is no surprise, then, that until today, there was no precedent for how an egg donor treats the amounts received in exchange for the process for taxable income purposes. This afternoon, however, the Tax Court decided Perez v. Commissioner, 144 T.C. 4, (2015), and concluded definitively that the amounts represent taxable income. Facts in Perez Nichelle Perez, a California resident, contracted with Donor Source International, LLC (Donor Source) to sell her eggs to women who struggled to conceive on their own. During 2009, Perez went through two donation cycles and was paid a total of $20,000. For each donation, Perez entered into two contracts–one with Donor Source and one with the anonymous intended parent. The contract with Donor Source made clear that Perez was not selling her eggs, intimating instead that she was being compensated for her physical suffering: “Donor Fee: Donor and Intended Parents will agree upon a fee for Donor’s time, effort, inconvenience, pain, and suffering in donating her eggs. This fee is for Donor’s good faith and full compliance with the donor egg procedure, not in exchange for or purchase of eggs and the quantity or quality of eggs retrieved will not affect the Donor Fee. The parties plainly acknowledge and agree that the funds provided to the Donor shall not in any way constitute payment to Donor for her eggs.”The contract with the prospective parent read the same, stating that payment was “in consideration for all of her pain, suffering, time, inconvenience, and efforts.” Taxpayer Position The underlined contractual language above was of critical importance to Perez. This is because generally, Section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that gross income includes all income from whatever sources derived, including compensation for services. There is an exception found at Section 104(a)(2), however, which excludes from taxable income the amount of any damages (other than punitive damages) received on account of personal injuries or physical sickness. Based on the language of the contract, Perez believed that the $20,000 she received in 2009 was to compensate her for the physical injuries she suffered as part of the egg donation process, and thus, fit within the ambit of Section 104 and was excludable from her taxable income. A cursory search of the internet reveals that many donors feel exactly the same way. As a result, Perez did not report the $20,000 of taxable income, despite the fact that Donor Source issued her a Form 1099 in that amount. IRS Position The IRS disagreed, arguing that regardless of the contractual language, the $20,000 Perez received was in exchange for services provided; in essence, while Perez may not have been selling her eggs, she was providing a service when she went through the process of donating her eggs. Tax Court Decision With some trepidation, the Tax Court took on the issue of whether the $20,000 Perez received was in fact taxable compensation, or if it represented a tax-free recovery of physical damages. It is important to note, however, that just as important to Judge Holmes was what the case wasn’t about: it wasn’t about whether human eggs are capital assets, how to allocate basis in the human body, the holding period for body parts, or the character of gain from the sale of those parts, which from a tax geek’s perspective is a damn shame, because that would have made for fascinating theater. The court didn’t have to take on these issues, however, because the contracts made clear that Perez was not selling her eggs, as she would be compensated whether she produced any useable eggs or not. To determine if the payments were a tax-free recovery of physical damages, the court looked next to the language of the Section 104 regulations; specifically, were the amounts received by Perez ”damages” under the meaning of the regulations? Reg. Section 1.104-1(c)(1) defines the term “damages” as “an amount received (other than workers’ compensation” through prosecution of a legal suit or action, or through a settlement agreement entered into in lieu of prosecution.” Because Perez conceded she had neither sued nor settled with Donor Source, she attacked the very validity of the regulations, arguing that the IRS did not have the power to limit “damages” to amounts received in a lawsuit or due to the threat of one. Instead, “damages” should extend to situations where a taxpayer received compensation in money for a loss regardless of legal suit or action. I’ll spare you the details of the court’s jaunt through the legislative history, but ultimately, Judge Holmes concluded that the regulations were in fact valid. And as a result, they failed to help Perez, because she did not receive the $20,000 as a result of a legal suit or action. More importantly, she did not receive the amounts from any type of action — legal or otherwise– taken after the physical injuries occurred; to the contrary, she entered into a contract with Donor Source providing for $20,000 of payment before the injuries took place. Even more damning, the injuries were both anticipated and consensual; in fact, they were of the exact nature that Perez was advised to expect when she entered into her contract. Thus, Judge Holmes concluded: The injury here , as painful as it was to Perez, was exactly within the scope of the medical procedures to which she contractually consented. Twice. Had Donor Source or the clinic exceeded the scope of Perez’s consent, Perez may have a claim for damages. Her physical pain was a byproduct of performing a service contract, and we find that the payments were not made to compensate her for some unwanted invasion against her bodily integrity but to compensate her for services rendered. As a result, the amounts paid to Perez, and presumably to all future egg donors, represented taxable income.Difficult a decision as it was, it was likely necessary to avoid the dangerous precedent mentioned at the outset of this column. If an egg donor could successfully argue that amounts received compensated her for injuries of a job she consented to and were thus tax-free, than what is to prevent a football player from arguing that part of his salary is intended to compensate him for concussions suffered, or a miner from contending that a portion of his compensation was meant to make him whole for future lung damage, resulting in a portion of the compensation in both cases becoming tax-free? The tax law is harsh and unforgiving, and often times, precedent must be decided with an eye towards the future, and with consideration of the inevitable abuse of the authority established by enterprising taxpayers. Thus, while the decision in Perez is sure to be unpopular, it was the correct one. follow along on twitter @nittigrittytax",

    "title": "Hedge Fund Chief: 'Sorry' For Losing It All",
    "description": "It’s one of those rare moments of humility on Wall Street, a placed where “indicted but never convicted” is a badge of honor. A hedge fund chief who lost all of his client’s money told them he was sorry. Owen Li, founder of Canarsie Capital, wrote to his clients to say he had run their accounts down from $100 million less than a year ago to just $200,000. Reportedly, he got into a hole and took on a string of high-risk bests to try to save his firm. It didn’t work out. ”My only hope is that you understand that I acted in an attempt — however misguided — to generate higher returns for the fund and its investors. But even so, I acted overzealously, causing you devastating losses for which there is no excuse,” he wrote. Here’s the thing, though. Hedge funds are not supposed to be running extremely high-risk strategies. They’re supposed to “hedge” risk by investing in ways that protect wealthy investors from dramatic losses. You might not get an amazing return from a hedge fund (and it’s interesting that people think that’s the goal) but instead get a reasonable return with minimal risk of big losses. That’s why rich people use them. A hedge fund, if correctly operated, is in fact just one slice of a larger asset pie, one which includes stocks, bonds, real estate and commodities. There has been a lot of research over decades to support the idea that again, properly run, a limited hedge fund allocation can lower overall volatility in a very large portfolio. That’s why universities and endowments use them. Of course, as with any hot investing trend, demand outstrips supply. CalPERS, the big California state pension fund, famously gave up on hedge funds in 2013, precisely because their high fees were unjustifiable in the face of shoddy performance. Hedge fund alternative For ordinary retirement investors, the risk is far, far too high and the hedge effect can be purchased much more cheaply in other ways. By simply owning a well-designed, well-allocated portfolio of index funds you get a lot of risk management at a very low price. Rebalancing with discipline allows you to book gains as they occur, selling high and buying low in a timely fashion. All that’s left is to make sure that your exposure to higher volatility asset classes — chiefly stocks — is slowly lowered over time as you near retirement. Sometimes, you don’t get what you pay for in an actively managed fund, and sometimes you get something you never bargained for — high risk and poor oversight from the managers themselves.",
