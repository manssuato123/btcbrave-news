    "description": "If you grew up during the '90s and played NBA Jam, then you know the voice of Tim Kitzrow. His memorable commentary on the game became part of NBA Jam's blockbuster success in arcades. However, Kitzrow has revealed that he was paid a very small amount for his work in the first game. While speaking with The Escapist, Kitzrow disclosed that he was paid $50 an hour for his work on NBA Jam, which was the same amount of money he made recording lines for Bally Midway's pinball machines. It wasn't until after the game was released that Kitzrow realized that he should have charged more. \"I'd go in, do a couple of sessions, maybe 15 hours total, and that was it,\" recalled Kitzrow. \"I wasn't smart enough, savvy enough to know the business, to go, 'Gee, these games make a lot of money, maybe I should make more than $50 an hour.' I didn't have an agent at the time ... When the game came out and I found out it made a billion dollars, that's when I realized I'd made like $800 and change ... I thought, 'Well, I'm probably being underpaid, I might want to raise my rate.'\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 received a small update on November 25, and the patch notes revealed a much-needed fix for the campaign's Endgame mode. The update added a new protection for disconnects that previously caused players to lose all of their progress in the mode. Black Ops 7's Endgame works much like the high-risk/high-reward structure of extraction-style shooters. Players grind matches of Endgame to level up their characters' abilities and combat rating, and failing to successfully extract from the map means they lose everything. Unfortunately, players were losing everything to random disconnects and game crashes as well. Treyarch said it heard the feedback from players, and the new update adds a disconnect protection. Now when players drop into matches of Endgame, the game snapshots the player's Combat Rating at the start of the match. This means players will keep their progress that was snapshotted at the start of the match even if a disconnect or crash occurs. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

TimeSplitters, TimeSplitters 2, and TimeSplitters: Future Perfect were a trio of well-liked FPS titles created in the early 2000s by UK developer Free Radical. The developer was working on TimeSplitters 4 when it went bankrupt in 2008 and was later absorbed by Crysis developer Crytek. A few years later in 2013, Crytek gave its official blessing to a TimeSplitters fan project looking to keep the franchise alive, even going so far as to provide original TimeSplitters assets for the project. The IP would later be transferred to THQ Nordic (now part of the Embracer Group), which honored Crytek's original agreement for the fan project, even as it briefly resurrected Free Radical with the intent on bringing the TimeSplitters franchise back to life.

    "description": "Epic Games has come up with an entirely new way to promote Fortnite's Chapter 6 finale event and launch of Chapter 7 this weekend: by briefly turning the storm circle into a \"storm seven\" for an hour on Tuesday morning. Look at this: Fortnite Battle Royale's storm circle took on a new shape for a bit.The change occurred at 6 AM PT and was reverted at 7 AM, with all games that started during that one-hour window having this odd new storm circle. The change was a promotional stunt to build hype for the Chapter 7 launch on Saturday, November 29--the chapter finale live event, which will only play one time ever, is Fortnite's biggest event every year, as it usually draws player counts in the tens of millions for whatever spectacle Epic has in store. But the emphasis on the number 7 isn't just because we're about to start Chapter 7. During the finale live event we're also expecting the return of the Seven--Fortnite's Avengers-esque team of superheroes that had been led by Dwayne \"The Foundation\" Johnson until the end of Chapter 3, when they were eaten by evil liquid chrome. No members of the Seven have been seen since the start of Chapter 4, and the game pretty much stopped referencing them completely in Chapter 5, so their return would be a big deal.

    "description": "One of this year's biggest gaming stories is the $55 billion sale of Electronic Arts to a group of private investors including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. Subsequently, there have been rumors that Saudi Arabia is backing Paramount's bid for Warner Brothers, which Paramount has denied. Now, a new report suggests that the PIF won't be making any new major purchases any time soon after experiencing a cash-flow problem. According to The New York Times, the PIF has been hit by a number of investments that are underwater financially. The report specifically mentioned that the planned Saudi Arabian city Neom and a ski resort with robot workers are among the PIF assets that are currently flailing. Saudi Arabia's wealth still stems from its vast oil deposits, but the kingdom has limitations on how much oil it can sell without violating agreements and treaties already in place. That could potentially mean PIF has been spending resources faster than Saudi Arabia can replenish the fund. PIF spokesperson Marwan Bakrali denied the report and told the New York Times that the PIF still has $60 billion in cash and \"similar financial instruments.\" Technically, the sale of EA has yet to officially go through yet, and it still needs regulatory approval in the US and other countries before it can be finalized.

    "description": "Marvel Snap will pay homage to classic comic team-ups with its next limited-time mode, Team Clash. The mode will reimagine 30 cards as \"Team Clash\" versions with team-based synergies, and each team will have a passive ability to boost their strengths. The event will begin in late December. The five teams run the gamut of Marvel characters and classic team-ups: Avengers, X-Men, Thunderbolts, Guardians of the Galaxy, and the Spider-Verse. You'll be able to try out a pre-built deck with any of the five teams, or build your own custom Team Clash deck to try your own strategies. Your custom decks just need to have the six core cards for that team. Some cards have been subtly tweaked for the Team Clash mode, while others are completely different. For example, in the Avengers team, each time you play an Avenger, you give the others at that location +1 power. Team Clash Captain America has an ongoing ability similar to his regular one: Other Avengers at his location get +2 power. But Hulk has a bigger shift--a slight reduction in power, but an On Reveal that gains +2 power for each other Avenger at his location. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "This Indie Game Has Been Banned On Steam Before It's Even Released",
    "description": "Earlier this year, Valve changed its rules to prevent adult games from having early-access releases on Steam. That came in the aftermath of a broader push against adult titles on Steam and Itch.io, largely at the behest of banks and payment processors. The upcoming indie horror game Horses is rated M for Mature, but it's not an adult title. Regardless, Steam informed the developer, Santa Ragione, that Horses was banned from the platform in 2023. The developer claims Valve has never explained its reasons for the ban in the two years since the ruling. Horses is a first-person title that casts players as a ranch hand who spends two weeks at an increasingly bizarre and unsettling farm. The horses in this game aren't horses at all. They're naked humans wearing horse masks who are forced to act like beasts of burden. Santa Ragione insists that Horses is not pornographic, and the publisher jokingly added that it apologizes if it \"got your hopes up for horse porn.\" Instead, Santa Ragione says it's using \"challenging, unconventional material to encourage discussion. It invites players to examine why something feels the way it does, what it says about the characters and systems at work, and where their limits lie. It is about tension, not erotic content.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",
