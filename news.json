    "description": "Circana released its monthly sales report for November today, shining a light on how the North American video game business is performing. Hardware sales had a particularly difficult month, with sales falling 27%, from $949 million in November 2024 to $695 million in November 2025. November 2025 represented the lowest hardware spending total for a November month since November 2005 ($455 million). A total of 1.6 million game hardware units were sold in North America for November 2025, and that's the lowest since November 1995 (1.4 million units). While total unit sales dropped, the average price paid for a new game console reached a new record high for a November month, rising to $439, up 11% compared to November 2024. The higher average selling price is connected to the price increases that companies like Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, and others have implemented this year due to tariffs and other factors.

Black Ops 7 was the No. 1 best-selling game in North America for November, but the Call of Duty franchise experienced a double-digit percent decrease for full-game dollar sales compared to November 2024. Last year's game, Black Ops 6, was released in October. Despite the sales downturn, this marks the 18th straight year that a new Call of Duty game has ranked No. 1 for its launch month. For anyone keeping score, that streak began with 2008's Call of Duty: World at War. Black Ops 7 is now the No. 7 best-selling game of 2025 so far, with EA's Battlefield 6 continuing to rank No. 1 for the year. For November, Black Ops 7 was No. 1, followed by Battlefield 6, NBA 2K26, Madden NFL 26, and EA Sports FC 26 rounding out the top five for the month. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Back in July, Turn 10 Studios was hit with massive layoffs, and players noticed that new content for the game had begun to slow down.

Starting on December 18, players will be to put presents under their tree--so to speak--by clobbering creatures for loot and bringing a little hope back to Estuar. To claim their prizes, players will have to face hordes of Treasure Goblins and earn their place on the March of the Goblins reputation board. There are multiple tiers to unlock, and players can claim their prizes between each one by visiting the Goblin Square in Kyovashad. Once players complete the final tier, they will be given a Resplendent Spark. That final tier is repeatable, and the quality of the loot dropped by enemies will increase with each tier. However, players will only have until January 6, 2026 to work their way through and claim as much treasure as they can. Returning Grim Favors during Goblin Greedings will also give players an additional cache for Gift of the Tree. All they need to do to claim it is to select a cache, which will reveal the treasure they've been given by the Gift of the Tree. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Like Fanatical's other build your own bundle promotions, you can pick as many games from the list as you'd like, and the more games you buy, the more you save. To start, you can pick up to four games for $3.33 each. At five or more games, you'll pay $3 per item. Grab 10 or more games, and you'll pay just $2.90 per game, and if you want the full 22-game bundle, it'll run you $63.78, a $547.75 value--not too shabby for literally thousands of hours of entertainment. See bundle at Fanatical One of the items you can pick, the SteamWorld Classic Bundle, comes with four games: SteamWorld Dig, SteamWorld Dig 2, SteamWorld Heist, and SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech.
