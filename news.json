    "title": "WoW Housing Is Finally Here, But There Is A Crack In The Foundation",
    "description": "In the 21 years since World of Warcraft launched, one feature has been asked about and requested above all others: player housing. Despite being the premier MMORPG for over two decades, housing in WoW has always felt like a pipedream. Now, that dream is finally a reality, as an early-access version of player housing is launching December 2 for those who preorder WoW's eleventh expansion, Midnight. It's been a long time coming. Housing as a feature was experimented with in WoW's earliest days but never came to fruition. In 2014, WoW's Warlords of Draenor expansion gave players a taste of what a full-fledged player housing system could be in the form of Garrisons. These large, base-like personal towns met nearly all of a player's needs in one location. But Garrisons quickly became more of a lesson in what Blizzard shouldn't do when it came to player housing. Barely customizable, Garrisons were also extremely isolating. With access to so many amenities in one, private location, players didn't need to be out in the world or hanging out in one of WoW's capital cities. Garrisons whetted players appetites for housing, but whenever Blizzard was asked about when a proper housing system might arrive, it always replied that it wanted to do the feature justice and was waiting for the right moment to make it happen.

    "description": "Arc Raiders players recently discovered an exploit that allowed them to loot locked rooms without needing a keycard. Naturally, the exploit quickly became popular--and frustrating for players who didn't use it--leading Embark Studios to apply a \"hot\" fix to this part of the game. If you now decide to cheese your way into one of these treasure rooms, you can now expect a toasty reception inside. Using a keycard to access one of these rooms ties into the high-risk, high-reward nature of Arc Raiders, but the exploit essentially bypasses it. Players managed to break into the room, grab valuable gear without worrying about being ambushed, and pick the location clean. This meant that players who unlocked the room properly would find it stripped bare, leading to frustration within the Arc Raiders community. To remedy this, Embark Studios made it so that the rooms automatically activate flamethrowers when you glitch into them. Players quickly found out that they would be caught inside this deathtrap, while other players with keycards would discover a room full of loot and a freshly cremated adventurer.

Over the Thanksgiving weekend, hawkish Redditors noticed a demo reel posted by former Rockstar Games animator Benjamin Chue. The two-minute reel featured animations from games like GTA 5, Max Payne 3, Red Dead Redemption 2, and, as spotted by IGN and VGC, three clips from what appears to be pre-alpha GTA 6 footage. The reel was quickly scrubbed off the internet, but Redditors found and posted mirrors of it. And as viewed by GameSpot, the clips do look like early GTA 6. One clip shows a male character detach a \"LomBike\"--likely a parody of the IRL LimeBike rental service--from its docking station, turn it around, and sit on it. Seconds later, that same character returns the bike to its dock. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
