    "title": "Arc Raiders Is My Game Of The Year, But Its Use Of Generative AI Really Sucks",
    "description": "These past two months with Arc Raiders have been the most fun I've had with games all year. It represents the most exciting and unpredictable multiplayer landscape I've jumped into since Sea of Thieves in 2018, which I consider my favorite game ever made. It's safe to say I really love Arc Raiders. But it's become difficult to fully espouse those feelings as we learn about Embark Studio's use of generative AI. According to the studio, Arc Raiders' voice acting was initially performed by humans, then used to \"train\" AI so that it could speak in the actors' voices while addressing any possible circumstance. For Embark, the team doesn't need to bring in the voice actors each time new content is added to the game. The AI voices learn to speak in the voices of the actors, which the actors are said to have agreed upon when they were hired, and the tools take it from there. Maybe it shouldn't have come as a surprise, since the team's previous game, The Finals, uses generative AI in a similar way. In an interview, Embark assured players that the game's visual artwork is entirely human-made, but admitted to using this text-to-speech training to bring voices to the game's shop NPCs, emotes, and other character barks. Knowing this has left me conflicted when I think to sing the game's praises. On one hand, I can't deny the hold Arc Raiders has taken over me. The heart wants what the heart wants, and Embark's extraction shooter, rich in emergent, player-driven drama, has lit my heart on fire in a way few games ever have. At the same time, I've already written my review. Though it was a glowing one that I don't regret, I also feel it's my job to call out this disappointing practice. In recent weeks, similar practices or plans have arisen in several high-profile examples. Larian Studios' boss vouched for it in some cases. Nexon's former CEO said AI is about to rewrite everything in the games industry. Ubisoft announced it's using an AI tool to help write its games in some instances. Even Hideo Kojima, often considered a unique voice in the industry, says he uses it at times. It's being presented as not just helpful, but inevitable. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Aspyr product manager Jordon Reese was recently asked by Nintendo Everything about the possibility of the other Survivor trilogy games--Rise of the Tomb Raider and Shadow of the Tomb Raider--coming to Switch 2. Reese didn't directly confirm those titles, but he also seemed to leave the door open for them. \"We've successfully brought back the classic era [Tomb Raider 1-6] and now the origin story of Lara Croft to modern Nintendo platforms,\" said Reese. \"We can't announce anything at the moment, but the passionate response to this release is strong encouragement for us to continue exploring those possibilities.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The actor who provided the motion capture for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's Gustave has spoken out to say it would be \"more logical\" to have a Best Character category at awards shows to help give credit to everyone who contributed to bringing a character to life in a game. The actor, Maxence Cazorla, is saying this against the backdrop of only one person, voice actor Charlie Cox, being nominated for Best Performance at The Game Awards for the role of Gustave. For what it's worth, Cox was open in acknowledging that Cazorla deserved credit, too, and Cazorla said Cox was kind to say that. Cox did not end up winning Best Performance, as it was Jennifer English as Maelle from Expedition 33 who took home the award. In any event, Cazorla told Eurogamer that he believes a \"Best Character category feels more logical\" than \"isolating a single performer and potentially leaving others invisible.\" Whether or not this is something that host and organizer Geoff Keighley is considering for next year's The Game Awards is unknown.

She is optimistic about the technology overall, though. \"If we can break the magic with AI it will help us be more innovative and more creative,\" she said. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

But just two days after its latest win, The Indie Game Awards stripped Expedition 33 of its two wins over the developer's use of AI. \"The Indie Game Awards have a hard stance on the use of gen AI throughout the nomination process and during the ceremony itself,\" reads a statement on The Indie Game Awards' official site (via Insider Gaming). \"When it was submitted for consideration, representatives of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. In light of Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from its nomination.\" Following that decision, The Indie Game Awards named Blue Prince as its new Game of the Year.

    "description": "Despite Netflix announcing a deal with Warner Bros. Discovery to acquire the media and entertainment behemoth, Paramount has not given up on its own attempt to acquire the company by going directly to shareholders. Now, Paramount has announced that it has further sweetened its proposal in a bid to make a deal. Paramount, which is run by David Ellison, has offered an \"irrevocable personal guarantee\" from his father, billionaire Oracle founder Larry Ellison, of $40.4 billion. Additionally, Paramount announced that it would increase and match Netflix's fee of $5.8 billion to be paid to WBD if the deal gets struck down in the regulatory process. Paramount's previous breakup fee was $5 billion. What's more, Paramount said its revised proposal includes \"further improved flexibility to WBD on debt refinancing transactions, representations, and interim operating covenants.\" The updated offer also includes the publishing of records that show the Ellison family trust owns 1.16 billion shares of Oracle stock, which is an attempt to show WBD shareholders that the Ellisons can indeed finance their $40.4 billion of the proposed $108 billion all-cash offer.
