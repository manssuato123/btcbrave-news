According to Aspyr, the response has been so strong that more Tomb Raider games may make the leap to Switch 2. Aspyr product manager Jordon Reese was recently asked by Nintendo Everything about the possibility of the other Survivor trilogy games--Rise of the Tomb Raider and Shadow of the Tomb Raider--coming to Switch 2. Reese didn't directly confirm those titles, but he also seemed to leave the door open for them. \"We've successfully brought back the classic era [Tomb Raider 1-6] and now the origin story of Lara Croft to modern Nintendo platforms,\" said Reese. \"We can't announce anything at the moment, but the passionate response to this release is strong encouragement for us to continue exploring those possibilities.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The actor, Maxence Cazorla, is saying this against the backdrop of only one person, voice actor Charlie Cox, being nominated for Best Performance at The Game Awards for the role of Gustave. For what it's worth, Cox was open in acknowledging that Cazorla deserved credit, too, and Cazorla said Cox was kind to say that. Cox did not end up winning Best Performance, as it was Jennifer English as Maelle from Expedition 33 who took home the award. In any event, Cazorla told Eurogamer that he believes a \"Best Character category feels more logical\" than \"isolating a single performer and potentially leaving others invisible.\" Whether or not this is something that host and organizer Geoff Keighley is considering for next year's The Game Awards is unknown.

All you need to do to claim the free games is create a free Epic account and enable two-factor authentication. You have a week to add the freebies to your library before the new one(s) take their place. At this point, Epic has given away hundreds of free games, and there's no sign that the program will stop any time soon. The company has also extended its freebies to Android devices, and you can claim a free game every week here as well.

Normally $500, the console bundle is discounted to $450 as a last-minute holiday deal. This promotion could expire at any time. There's another possible reason why this Cyber Monday deal has returned at major retailers. According to an internal GameStop memo shared by Nintendeal, the bundle is no longer in production. This isn't a surprise, as Nintendo originally stated the bundle would only be available until Fall 2025. In any case, this could be your last chance to not only save on the bundle, but buy it from a major retailer in general. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The statement was paraphrased and not attributed to any specific person at Microsoft, and GameSpot has followed up with Microsoft in an attempt to get more information. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Microsoft pushed the Xbox team to increase profit margins starting in 2023, with the goal of rising to 30% (up from 12% in 2022). The industry average for profit margins is likely between 17% and 22%, analysts said in the Bloomberg piece. According to the report, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood implemented the new goals, and her team has \"taken a larger role\" in the company's gaming business recently. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Battlefield 6 players believe they have discovered evidence that the game features AI-generated art. People are theorizing that some of the art in player emblems in Battlefield 6 was created, at least in part, with the use of generative AI systems, though there is no concrete evidence of this as of yet or any comment from Electronic Arts or the game's developers. People have pointed out some apparent irregularities with the art below. GameSpot has contacted EA in an attempt to get more details on the situation. This definitely looks AI Generated right? #Battlefield6 pic.twitter.com/VLYMhEMOqQ — Battlefield 6 News (@BF6Updates) December 21, 2025 Battlefield 6 is getting accused of using Gen AI. pic.twitter.com/fa2E79X8as — Shooter Intel (@ShooterIntel) December 22, 2025 Back in October, DICE GM Rebecka Coutaz said EA's teams use generative AI in the early stages of development \"to allow more time and more space to be creative.\" But Battlefield 6 has no gen AI-created content, she said. She is optimistic about the technology overall, though. \"If we can break the magic with AI it will help us be more innovative and more creative,\" she said. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

But just two days after its latest win, The Indie Game Awards stripped Expedition 33 of its two wins over the developer's use of AI. \"The Indie Game Awards have a hard stance on the use of gen AI throughout the nomination process and during the ceremony itself,\" reads a statement on The Indie Game Awards' official site (via Insider Gaming). \"When it was submitted for consideration, representatives of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. In light of Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from its nomination.\" Following that decision, The Indie Game Awards named Blue Prince as its new Game of the Year.

Discovery to acquire the media and entertainment behemoth, Paramount has not given up on its own attempt to acquire the company by going directly to shareholders. Now, Paramount has announced that it has further sweetened its proposal in a bid to make a deal. Paramount, which is run by David Ellison, has offered an \"irrevocable personal guarantee\" from his father, billionaire Oracle founder Larry Ellison, of $40.4 billion. Additionally, Paramount announced that it would increase and match Netflix's fee of $5.8 billion to be paid to WBD if the deal gets struck down in the regulatory process. Paramount's previous breakup fee was $5 billion. What's more, Paramount said its revised proposal includes \"further improved flexibility to WBD on debt refinancing transactions, representations, and interim operating covenants.\" The updated offer also includes the publishing of records that show the Ellison family trust owns 1.16 billion shares of Oracle stock, which is an attempt to show WBD shareholders that the Ellisons can indeed finance their $40.4 billion of the proposed $108 billion all-cash offer.
