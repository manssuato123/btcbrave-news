And to entice players to stick around, Funcom is also offering a 25% discount until December 1. Players who take part in the free trial will be allowed \"to taste the spice and explore the vast Hagga Basin map in search of the Fremen\" for up to 10 hours during the trial period. Funcom also notes that this trial allows newcomers to play on any server in the world with existing players. Any progress made in their exploration will carry over if players ultimately buy Dune: Awakening. Last summer, Funcom shared a glimpse of Dune: Awakening's ambitious roadmap of free and paid DLC. Chapter 3's free update will feature a revamped endgame, and there haven't been any specific details about what will be included with Chapter 4. However, Funcom has already made some of the fan-requested changes to Awakening, including endgame changes, improved player logging and deep desert loot, as well as a way to locate or salvage lost vehicles. Chapter 3 will debut between January 2026 and March 2026, while Chapter 4 will follow between April 2026 and June 2026. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Battlefield 6's new California Resistance update is out now, adding a range of new things for players to experience, including a brand-new map, Eastwood. The map is hiding a Breaking Bad Easter Egg, players have discovered, and it's one of the best-known Breaking Bad references from the show. One of the buildings on the new Eastwood map has a pizza on the roof of its garage--this is pretty clearly a reference to the show's 2010 Season 3, Episode 2 episode, \"Caballo sin Nombre.\" In this episode, Walter (Bryan Cranston) tosses an entire pizza onto the roof in a fit of rage. Now, you can see that pizza in Battlefield 6, or something like it. This scene became an internet meme, and other games, like High on Life, have referenced it as well. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Resident Evil Requiem Will See Returning Characters, But Don't Get Too Excited",
    "description": "We already know Resident Evil Requiem will focus on Grace Ashcroft, daughter of Resident Evil Outbreak's Alyssa Ashcroft. But the new protagonist will come across other returning characters from the franchise, too, according to producer Masato Kumazawa. However, the developer wants to manage expectations, as rumors mount about Resident Evil 2 and 4 protagonist Leon Kennedy appearing in the game. Speaking with Well Played (via Eurogamer), Kumazawa was asked about more Resident Evil Outbreak characters popping up in Requiem. \"I would say that yes, there are going to be some characters from the past series to come in, but don't over-expect or hype it,\" the producer said. \"We can't promise you anything about that, but the only thing I can say is that there will be characters that have been involved in the Raccoon City incident involved in the game.\" Leon starred alongside Claire Redfield in Resident Evil 2, which was set in Raccoon City. So he definitely fits the criteria teased by Kumazawa. On the flip side, Capcom explained why Leon was a \"bad match\" for Resident Evil Requiem earlier this year. The caveat and wiggle room here for Capcom is that Leon was discussed as the protagonist in this light, meaning that he could still show up as an NPC. That said, Kumuzawa is clearly trying to temper expectations. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Why Did Rockstar Delay GTA 6?",
    "description": "Rockstar's highly anticipated open-world game GTA 6 was supposed to be released around right now, in Fall 2025, but the game has seen multiple delays since it was originally announced. Now, the game is slated for release in about a year on November 19, 2026, following a pushback from May 26, 2026. Why was GTA 6 delayed a second time? And how does the delay pattern for GTA 6 line up with Rockstar's previous releases? We're breaking down all the key things to know in this post. Rockstar's rationale for delaying GTA 6 In early November, Rockstar announced that GTA 6 was being delayed by 5 months and 24 days, from May 26 to November 19. But why did Rockstar make the decision to delay the game once again? The company said it came down to quality. \"These extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve,\" the studio said.

    "description": "Europe's law enforcement agency is taking a closer look at online multiplayer games and gaming-adjacent platforms as the fears that criminals could be grooming, manipulating, and weaponizing children to commit violent crimes rise sharply in European society. Europol (or the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation) partnered with eight countries to identify and remove thousands of incidents of hateful rhetoric shared on gaming and gaming-related platforms. Conducted on November 13 and in partnership with Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom, Europol's Referral Action Day program reportedly uncovered around 5,408 links to jihadist content, 1,070 links to violent right-wing extremist and terrorist content, and 105 links to racist and xenophobic content on a variety of unnamed gaming platforms. Europol's executive director, Catherine De Bolle, spoke to Politico on November 21 about her fears following the findings by that joint committee dubbed the European Union Internet Referral Unit (EU IRU). De Bolle said that, through these gaming platforms, criminal networks are recruiting children to engage in torture and murder. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "In February 2023, Wizards of the Coast closed an internal game development studio, and with it cancelled multiple unannounced titles, one of them being Whimpact!, a \"Pokemon meets Fall Guys\" online multiplayer game. Rather than let it die, Leah Hoyer, who was at the time VP of creative for WotC, opened her own studio called Level Headed Games, acquired the rights to Whimpact!, and continued development--and it's set to release in early access soon. Whimpact! drops players into the world of Whims, cute little creatures that pass along magical powers to those who collect and care for them. The more they're cared for, the stronger those powers will be. Up to eight players will be able to join together in co-op arena-style gameplay as they collect Whims, gather mystical energy called Starcane, and navigate obstacles while fighting hordes of robotic invaders trying to steal the energy for themselves. Gallery There are seven different types of Whims to collect, each with six different color variants. The power each Whim gives the player will depend on its color, with powers including increased speed, increased strength, high jumping ability, longer jumping ability, and more. Players will be able to mix and match powers, including swapping Whims on the fly, during a match as well. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
