    "description": "Persona 3 Reload (Switch 2) $40 (was $60) See at Amazon If you've picked up a Switch 2 console recently and you're looking to grab a game that'll keep you entertained for nearly 100 hours, Persona 3 Reload comes highly recommended, and it's on sale at Amazon for $40 (was $60) thanks to the retailer's Black Friday event. If you don't own a Switch 2, you can also grab the game on PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X, but like many of the other video game deals in Amazon's event, these Persona 3 Reload discounts could run out fast, so don't wait--it could be Dark Hour on these deals before you know it. Persona 3 Reload (Switch 2) $40 (was $60) Persona 3 Reload is a full-scale remake of the 2006 classic, introducing new characters, expanded storylines, an all-new voice cast, and a re-recorded soundtrack. The game also features quality-of-life improvements and a redesigned interface that refines the experience while preserving the heart of the cult-classic PS2 original. Note that the Switch 2 version of the game comes on a Game Key-Card, which means none of the game data is included on the cart. Instead, inserting the physical game into your system unlocks the digital version, which you must download to your console before you can start playing. Expect Persona 3 Reload to take up about 25GB on your Switch 2's internal storage or SD card. It's also worth pointing out is that the Episode Aigis DLC expansion is available a separate $35 purchase on the Switch 2 eShop. Episode Aegis adds roughly 30 hours of new story content that takes place after the base game's ending, along with new costumes and music. See at Amazon While Persona 3 Reload came to Switch 2 just a few months ago, it originally launched on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, and PC back in early 2024. The physical PlayStation and Xbox versions also happen to be on sale at Amazon, and at much lower prices than the Switch 2 version. You can check out all the Persona 3 Reload Black Friday deals below. All Persona 3 Reload Black Friday Deals Switch 2 -- $40 ($60) PS5 -- $18 ($70) PS4 -- $20 ($70) Xbox Series X -- $25 ($35.16) Persona 3 Reload is just one of several Atlus-published RPGs on sale at Amazon during Black Friday. You can also grab Persona 5 Royal on Switch, Metaphor ReFantazio, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance Edition, and the recently released Raidou Remastered: the Mystery of the Soulless Army. Check out all the Atlus RPG deals at Amazon.

Select Ray-Ban Meta AI Glasses models are seeing generous discounts for Black Friday 2025. These are all Gen 1 models--so they won't have the extended battery life or upgraded cameras of the Gen 2 models--but they still offer many of the same features as the newer models, including Meta AI support, built-in speakers and camera, and more. While the smart glasses are available in a variety of frames and lens styles, it looks like only the Wayfarer frames are currently getting discounts. You can snag a pair for as low as $239.20 (normally $299) thanks to Amazon's sale. Ray-Ban X Meta Smart Glasses - Wayfarer Frames (Gen 1) Starts at $239 If you're unfamiliar with Meta's collaboration with Ray-Ban, these smart glasses aren't your average pair of frames. Inside its larger arms, you'll find heaps of cool tech that lets you ask Meta AI questions, take photos or videos, or listen to music. You can even ask Meta AI what you're looking at, making the smart glasses a helpful travel companion. The frames are only slightly thicker than those of some typical glasses, so unless someone is looking closely, most won't even realize you have a computer sitting on your head. As for the actual specs, you'll find an ultra-wide 12MP camera, a five-mic system for easy voice recognition, an included charging and travel case, and a built-in button to activate its AI. Any images or footage you capture can also be easily shared on Facebook or Instagram. See at Amazon While these AI-powered smart glasses are stylish, they're much simpler compared to AR and VR devices. Those who are interested in something more powerful should also check out Amazon's limited-time Black Friday deals on the Meta Quest 3S VR headset.

The Lenovo Legion Go S has been heavily discounted, with prices ranging from $450 (was $650) for the Z2 model with a 512GB SSD and the version with the Z1 Extreme chipset, more RAM, and a 1TB SSD is available for $650 (was $900). These powerful portable gaming devices let you play the latest PC games on the go, making them an excellent gift for the hardcore PC gamer in your life. Just make sure you grab these deals soon, as these Best Buy discounts won't last long. Legion Go S (Z2, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) $450 (was $650) The Lenovo Legion Go S comes equipped with an 8-inch 120Hz Lenovo PureSight 1200p display and an AMD Ryzen Z2 Go chip with Radeon graphics. This model includes a 512GB SSD, 16GB of RAM, and it runs on Valve's operating system, SteamOS. Storage can be expanded through the microSD slot if 512GB feels too limiting. Games typically run well from a microSD card on SteamOS, and the Z2 chip paired with Radeon graphics can handle a wide range of titles. The handheld measures 11.75 x 1.71 x 5.02 inches, and it has a 3.5mm audio jack, two USB-C ports, offset thumbsticks, two remappable back triggers, and a small trackpad. See at Best Buy Legion Go S (Z1 Extreme, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) $650 (was $900) The higher-end configuration of the Lenovo Legion Go S uses the older but still powerful AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip with AMD RDNA 3 graphics. It has 32GB of RAM and a larger 1TB SSD, and like the model above, it runs on SteamOS. It features the same screen, inputs, and ergonomic design that has earned praise from critics. See at Best Buy Other handheld gaming PCs, such as the recently released ROG Xbox Ally X, are still selling at their regular MSRP, but Best Buy is offering discounts on the MSI Claw. You can save $180 to $265 on two models: the MSI Claw A1M with a 512GB SSD is down to $390, down from $650, while the 1TB version is $565 (was $750). These units feature 7-inch 1080p screens with a 120Hz refresh rate; 16GB of RAM, Intel Arc Graphics 8X cores, and Intel Core Ultra processors. MSI Claw A1MBoth MSI Claw models run Windows 11, which means you can load games from multiple storefronts, including Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store. The trade-off is that Windows can be cumbersome on a handheld PC, but if that does not bother you, you will have far more flexibility when installing and managing games.

The game features a remaster of 2011's Sonic Generations alongside the all-new Shadow Generations, offering fans two completely unique games in one package. And now, for Black Friday 2025, the game is discounted to its lowest price ever of just $25 (was $50) on Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X. You'll also find a bunch of other Sonic games on sale during the event, making this a good time to stock up on titles you may have missed over the past few years. Sonic X Shadow Generations $25 (was $50) Sonic X Shadow Generations offers both 3D and 2D adventures, playing as a greatest-hits roundup for the Blue Blur. For a change of pace, however, you can dive into Shadow Generations, which lets you take control of Shadow as he fights through a brand new adventure. There are plenty of Easter eggs and additional content packed into the bundle--so even once you beat the game, there's always a reason to come back for more.

Sonic X Shadow Generations Deals At Amazon PS5 -- $25 ($50) Xbox -- $25 ($50) Switch -- $25 ($50) Switch 2 -- $25 ($50) See all at Amazon Our Sonic X Shadow Generations review called it a \"nice enough trip down memory lane,\" though it does come with some friction due to the age of Sonic Generations. If you're a Sonic fan, you'll probably find something here of value (especially at $25). \"Shadow Generations' story is a great opportunity to revisit some of Shadow's most memorable moments as well as past boss battles against other artificial beings that could be considered rivals to the title of \"ultimate life form,\" like the Biolizard from Sonic Adventure 2,\" wrote critic Jordan Ramée. \"I was grinning like a kid again when Shadow faced off against Metal Overlord and Crush 40's \"What I'm Made Of...\" started playing, reminding me of the hours I lost to Sonic Heroes when I was 10 years old.\" Many other Sonic games are on sale for Black Friday, including Sonic Frontiers, which is down to $18 on PS5, $16 on PS4, $10 on Xbox Series X, and $25 on Switch. You can also pick up the Sonic Mania + Team Sonic Racing Double Pack for just $20 (was $40). You'll find a list of even more Sonic game deals below.

Metaphor ReFantazio deals at Amazon PS5 -- $35 ($70) Xbox Series X -- $35 ($70) See at Amazon Persona 3: Reload Starts at $18 A remake of 2006's Persona 3, Persona 3 Reload keeps the game's core story intact and elevates it with brand-new gameplay and visuals. Still faithful to the original, Persona 3 Reload makes an already great game even better with its enhancements. Amazon's pricing differs between consoles--PS5 owners can get the game for just $18, while the PS4 version is $20, the Xbox Series X version is $25, and the Switch 2 version is $40 (was $60). Note that the Switch 2 version is a game key-card release, meaning you have to download the digital version to your console (around 25.3GB file size) before you can play. Persona 3: Reload deals at Amazon PS5 -- $18 ($70) PS4 -- $20 ($70) Xbox Series X -- $25 ($70) Switch 2 (Game Key-Card) -- $40 ($60) See at Amazon Persona 5 Royal (Switch) $25 (was $60) Atlus had earned a loyal following over the years with its Persona games, but Persona 5 is arguably the game that put the company on radar of JRPG fans looking for something different. The anime art style, rich character relationships, and an overarching story that will take dozens of hours to complete made it a big hit, and the Royal Edition of the game fleshes out those aspects of the game even further with quality-of-life tweaks and more content. See at Amazon Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army $30 (was $50) Another blast from the past, Raidou Remastered is a remake of a 2006 PS2 game from the Shin Megami Tensei series. Part of the Devil Summoner subseries, the action-RPG features revamped visuals and audio, combat enhancements, brand voice acting, expanded 3D environments, and a slick user interface. Set in 1930s Tokyo, players embark on a supernatural adventure, collecting dozens of demons to aid them in their quest to prevent humanity from being consumed by darkness. As with other Atlus games released on Switch 2, Raidou Remastered's physical Switch 2 edition is a game key-card that grants access to the digital version of the game, rather than storing the game data on the cart. The game requires just under 12GB. Raidou Remastered deals at Amazon PS5 -- $30 ($50) Xbox Series X -- $40 ($50) Switch -- $30 ($50) Switch 2 (Game Key-Card) -- $30 ($50) See at Amazon Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance $18 (was $60) Originally exclusive to Nintendo Switch, Shin Megami Tensei eventually came to other consoles as part of an upgraded release, dubbed the Vengeance. This version of Shin Megami Tensei V addressed many of the original game's shortcomings, fine-tuning the combat and exploration while adding updated visuals and new story content. Set in a version of Tokyo destroyed by a demonic invasion, players harness this dark power on their journey as they amass an army of loyal demons. Note that Amazon's discount only appears to apply to the PS5 and Nintendo Switch versions of the game, both of which are cut to just $18 (normally $60). That's a massive 70% discount. The Xbox Series X edition is also available, but is currently priced at $45. Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance deals at Amazon PS5 -- $18 ($60) Xbox Series X -- $45 Switch -- $18 ($60) See at Amazon Amazon Black Friday Gaming Deals Check out all of the video game and hardware discounts.
