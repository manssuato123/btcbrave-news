    "description": "Developer Expression Games has released the first gameplay trailer for Hell Let Loose: Vietnam, a hardcore 50v50 first-person shooter set during the Vietnam War. A follow-up to 2021's Hell Let Loose--which was inspired by the conflicts of World War 2--players will have to once again rely on tactical teamwork to survive. Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will feature six new maps on launch day, each described by Expression Games as a mix of dense jungle, twisting deltas, and deadly open areas. You won't just be fighting on the ground either, as military helicopters serve multiple roles. From troop deployment to fire support, reconnaissance, and tactical drops, they're an invaluable tool in any match. Players can also engage each other in naval combat, as heavily armed vessels such as the iconic US patrol boat and the PBR will be featured in the game. Maps are also riddled with tunnel networks constructed by the North Vietnamese army, and these offer strategic advantages for surprise attacks and troop movements. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Although Romero and his company, Romero Games, didn't confirm that the project was a victim of Microsoft's layoffs and cutbacks, one of Romero Games' laid-off employees did. However, it appears the still-unnamed shooter isn't completely dead, according to Romero himself. During his appearance at Salón del Videojuego de Madrid (via Eurogamer), Romero confirmed that the project is back on, and that it's been given a fresh redesign. \"We're not starting at ground zero,\" said Romero. \"We can take pieces out of and put into a brand-new indie game. We have a lot of stuff we can put in the game. The design is completely different, but the team is very excited about the new design.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Revenue came in at $821 million, compared to $860.3 million during the same period last year, and short of Wall Street projections.

GameStop's stock price sank after the earnings report came out, with many saying the revenue miss was to blame for the falling price. Others, however, have said GameStop's strong profit-growth, along with having more than $8.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (up from $4.6 billion last year) is a sign of health. Additionally, GameStop's Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&amp;A) costs were $221.4 million for the quarter, down from $282 million during the same period last year.

    "description": "Baldur's Gate 3 has been out for over two years now, but fans' enthusiasm for the sprawling RPG remains strong--as is the case with one fan who has spent untold hours documenting and quantifying all the spoken dialogue in the game. Redditor Everwhite-moonlight has taken the time to catalogue the game's extensive spoken dialogue fans, calling the labor-intensive task a celebration of Larian's work. The finished spreadsheet arranges the characters in order from most to least speaking time, which reveals just how much our vampire friend Astarion loves to talk. It's unsurprising that Amelia Tyler's Narrator, whose voice is ever-present through Baldur's Gate 3 as the game's pseudo-DM, has the most lines of dialogue, clocking in at a total of 14 hours and 43 minutes of speaking time. What is surprising is how (relatively) close behind her Astarion sits, with a whopping 13 hours and 6 minutes of dialogue for the Neil Newbon-voiced vampire companion. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "It's been a busy week for industry speculation after Geoff Keighley started posting about a mysterious, glowing monolith in the middle of the California desert, which was later moved into Los Angeles. Now, it appears the monolith's mystery might have just been solved through a trademark filing. Rumors that the monolith was erected to tease new Diablo 4 content, Elder Scrolls 6, God of War, or Lords of the Fallen 2 were all shot down by people in the know. While others speculated that it still could be related to The Elder Scrolls Online, or a new FromSoft game, it appears most likely that the statue is promoting a new Divinity title from Larian. A trio of trademark filings were spotted up by MP1st, including a new Divinity logo and a symbol that looks suspiciously like the glowing one on Geoff Keighley's monolith. The familiar-looking trademarks come after Larian's publishing director said there aren't currently any plans for a Divinity: Original Sin 3, meaning the upcoming title may be a new Divinity game outside of the Original Sin prequel series.
