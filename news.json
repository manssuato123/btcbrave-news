However, the game's first (and potentially only) DLC, The Forsaken Hollows, introduces two new nightfarers that will mix things up even further: Scholar and Undertaker. The Scholar is a support character with high Arcane scaling (perfect for bleed builds) who can buff party members, debuff enemies, and make use of a powerful passive that levels items by simply using them. Meanwhile, the Undertaker has incredible scaling in Strength and Faith, as well as a high-damage ultimate ability that can be triggered multiple times while using her character skill, making her a perfect choice for aggressive players who love to dish out the pain while also having some extra healing options. If you're curious about these new characters and want to try them out for yourself, we've got you covered. Here's how to unlock the Scholar and Undertaker. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "If you saw the Shenmue 4 trailer that went viral recently and were hoping it was leading to an announcement, then you're going to be disappointed. Ys Net, the studio founded by Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki, has issued a statement condemning the trailer as a fake while also hinting that it may take legal action against the trailer's creator. In a post on social media, Ys Net said the fake Shenmue 4 trailer \"uses our company logo without permission, falsely giving the impression that is an official Shenmue 4 related video produced by us.\" The statement adds that there have been no official Shenmue 4 materials released, and that the studio is \"currently working with relevant parties and preparing appropriate measures, including potential legal action\" against the creator of the trailer. pic.twitter.com/YqUtrawpiE — YS NET Inc. (@YSNET_Inc) December 8, 2025 The original Shenmue was released in 1999 on Sega Dreamcast, and it cast players as a young man, Ryo Hazuki, as he sought to avenge his father's death. The game had innovative takes on open-world gameplay and quicktime events that proved to be very influential in the video game industry. Shenmue 2 followed in 2001, but the franchise went on hiatus due to low sales. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The Dead Space franchise is reportedly \"on ice\" at EA. And no, we're not referring to the frozen planet of Tau Volantis, the setting for Dead Space 3. Basically, there are no plans for a new sequel, remake, or even reboot of the survival-horror franchise. Insider Gaming states that EA sources have informed them about the latest Dead Space direction--or lack of direction, in this case. In early 2023, a remake of Dead Space was released, making people speculate about a new sequel or future remakes. But instead, there reportedly won't be any sort of followup anytime soon. GameSpot has reached out to EA for comment. The report adds that the same sources hope the company might sell the Dead Space franchise after EA sold itself for $55 billion to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and the private equity firm Silver Lake. The deal could lead to $20 billion in debt. As such, there's speculation EA could auction off Dead Space to help pay off that gigantic amount. But that raises questions: What company would want to acquire Dead Space? And would the sum be even a drop in the bucket against $20 billion? Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The open-world Wuxia sim is so hot that the explosive and sustained player count has surprised developer Everstone Studio, who said the numbers exceeded internal expectations. Lead producer Beralt Lyu spoke to FRVR about the game recently reaching nine million players on November 29, just two weeks after its worldwide launch. Lyu explained that while the team always had faith in their Wuxia world, they weren't expecting this much success this quickly. \"We hoped it would find its audience, the players who would love the freedom and mystery we tried to create,\" Lyu said. \"But [nine] million players in two weeks … that number has honestly blown all our internal expectations out of the water. The mood in the studio is hard to put into words. There's definitely pride and excitement--seeing years of hard work resonate with so many people is a feeling like no other.

Additionally, Paramount wants to buy the entirety of WBD, not just the majority of the key entertainment assets that Netflix is proposing to buy. Paramount's $30-per-share offer works out to a total enterprise value of $108.4 billion, which Paramount said is a 139% premium on where the company was trading at in September 2025.
