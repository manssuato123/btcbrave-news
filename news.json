    "description": "Five years after the first live-action Sonic the Hedgehog movie was released, fans have almost forgotten how close they came to seeing pure nightmare fuel in that blockbuster movie. The original Sonic design was a strange mix of blue fur and too many teeth, but the redesign of Sonic that followed was far more faithful to the video games. A26, a group of renegade Sonic fans, isn't satisfied with it. They're busy putting Ugly Sonic back into the movie, with a project called Sonic the Hedgehog: The 2019 Cut, and a trailer for it is set to be released on December 24. A26 originally intended to have the trailer out this week, but they weren't satisfied with the result and pushed the date back a few weeks. \"We wanted Sonic’s animation to feel as fluid as possible, and to be honest, it would have gotten some negative reviews if we’d released it today,\" A26 wrote in a social media post. \"We promise it will be totally worth it, paying tribute to the original design as it always should have been.\" A short clip for you all 🫣Hope you like It#GottaFixFast🌀🦔 pic.twitter.com/2ET7vPsZSV — Sonic The Hedgehog: The 2019 Cut (@SonicCut2026) December 11, 2025 To give you an idea of what you can expect, A26 releases a short GIF of Ugly Sonic jogging inside a washing machine. The project is expected to be released online in 2026. While it's going to be a long wait to see the 2019 cut of Sonic the Hedgehog, you can see the infamous character--voiced by I Think You Should Leave's Tim Robinson--save the day in 2022's Chip 'n Dale movie.

    "description": "The recent A Safehouse in the Hills update for GTA Online may contain clues about Grand Theft Auto VI, or at least that's what the franchise's passionate fanbase is theorizing based on some recent discoveries. After the big new update went live on December 10, people dug into the game's code in search of anything that might provide clues about GTA 6, and people think they found some. A line of text that was discovered references a voice line for the character Jimmy, the son of main character Michael, that says he is \"moving out of state.\" Another line, from his mother Amanda, says, \"Our son is finally moving away from home.\" People are taking this to suggest that Jimmy may have moved to Leonida, the stand-in for GTA 6's setting of Florida, but that's just conjecture for now. Dataminers also discovered that the KnoWay autonomous driving company that was added to GTA Online in the new update was formerly known as Sahara. That is the name of a delivery and logistics company for GTA 6, as seen in previously released GTA 6 screenshots. The dataminer, Tex2, theorized that Rockstar might have at one point planned a Part 2 for the A Safehouse in the Hills expansion to be timed with GTA 6's previous release date of May 2026 prior to the game's delay to November 2026.

    "description": "Bigfoot isn't a myth. It's real, and it's really wandering around the forests ... in Fortnite, as a new update added the mythical sasquatch to the battle royale shooter. Thanks to a recent 39.10 update that landed on December 11, players noticed something strange in Fortnite's woods. Apparently, Epic Games introduced Bigfoot to the game's sprawling world, but it isn't easy to find. Bigfoot roams the entire map, meaning it could appear by the Fore Fields, near the Humble Hills, and anywhere in between. It's also immune to damage, so shooting it means nothing. And if you get within 35 meters, it vanishes, leaving you on yet another wild sasquatch hunt before getting blasted to death. BIGFOOT WAS ADDED IN TODAY'S UPDATE 😭He walks around the entire map, is immune to damage, and will disappear if you get too close to him(via @FN_Assist) pic.twitter.com/Mdi5GxeSoU — Shiina (@ShiinaBR) December 11, 2025 Contrary to its name, however, Bigfoot isn't that big. As players found it, it actually appears rather little. The perspective could be off, but based on screenshots circulating on X, Bigfoot looks no bigger than a budding flower. Maybe it should be known as \"Littlefoot,\" then. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Kotaku reported that a 60-second trailer can cost up to $450,000, with the price scaling to $1 million for a three-minute trailer. The ad sales team for The Game Awards can charge that much due in part to the show's massive scale. The Game Awards 2024 drew an audience of 154 million livestreams, which was up from 118 million for The Game Awards 2023. This counts streams on YouTube, Twitch, Steam, TikTok, X, Instagram, Facebook, and international platforms like Bilibili and WeChat in China, among other sources. The viewership number for The Game Awards 2024 was many millions higher than the latest Super Bowl (127.7 million), but the comparison is not apples to apples. Super Bowl ads for Super Bowl LIX this past February reportedly cost as much as $8 million for 30 seconds. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been one of 2025's breakout success stories in gaming, and it was developed on a relatively small budget, apparently. The New York Times reports that the budget was \"less than $10 million,\" crediting the information to developer Sandfall. The report added that the team \"conserved resources\" by purposefully avoiding an open-world setup in favor of making Expedition 33 a turn-based game. Sandfall's Guillaume Broche said Sandfall now has the right technology to \"make those games with a relatively small team,\" and he hopes to see more like it from other studios.

Arrowhead Game Studios CCO and Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt has revealed that there is a prototype version of a roguelite mode, and he hinted that it brings some big changes to the game. Pilestedt shared the news while replying to a message on social media, adding that \"It changes the game fundamentally!\" Hey! We have a prototype of a rogue-lite mode - it changes the game fundementally! — Pilestedt (@Pilestedt) December 10, 2025 It's currently unclear what the roguelite version of Helldivers 2 would entail, and whether it will ultimately be released. The only thing that Pilestedt has confirmed is that a roguelite prototype exists. Everything else is speculation for now. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Players called the port a \"disaster,\" and many more reported major input lag and a locked 30 frames per second. Over on Reddit, the details of the lag became apparent when someone posted the delay between moving the Joy-Con stick and his character reacting in the game. \"There's like a whole second between me flicking the stick and my character moving its head.\" Input delay on Skyrim (Switch 2 Edition) is terrible byu/AZURE-Spirit inNintendoSwitch The discussion evolved into comparing Skyrim's Switch 2 version to Cyberpunk 2077, which runs at 40 frames per second on the same hardware while showing more detailed worlds. Another common complaint is the game's size: Skyrim takes up 53GB of the Switch 2's limited internal storage, even though it uses only 25GB on PC. For many fans, this raised questions about how the port was handled. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Maybe as a holiday treat, Nintendo has added a new GameCube title for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers out of the blue. Wario World is now playable for the service on Switch 2. Originally released in 2003, Wario World is a 3D platformer that sees the antihero looking for payback after his treasure is stolen and his castle destroyed. Coincidentally, Treasure is the developer behind the GameCube title. The studio is known for Gunstar Heroes, Sin and Punishment, and Ikaruga. Wario World brings the GameCube library up to seven titles on Switch 2 for the Expansion Pack tier. What's intriguing about Wario World is that Nintendo has teased GameCube titles that still aren't out on the service, such as Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance and Pokemon Colosseum. Meanwhile, Wario World hadn't previously been mentioned. Luigi's Mansion arrived on the subscription service right before Halloween and was the last addition. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
