It's not the only Bethesda adaptation coming to Amazon's streaming service--a Wolfenstein show is coming as well--and some fans are hoping to see The Elder Scrolls game follow. Bethesda's Todd Howard--who has worked as a producer on Fallout and Elder Scrolls titles--won't rule out the possibility that it could happen. But don't expect an Elder Scrolls series anytime soon. While speaking with Eurogamer, Howard said that he \"can't rule in or rule out an Elder Scrolls thing in the future,\" before adding that he thought Fallout was more suitable as an adaptation because it had \"more to say in its genre.\" \"But you never know,\" added Howard. \"I think the impact of the show on Fallout as a franchise has been bigger than I expected, so it does make you think like, 'Hey, is there a path?' But nothing today… [and] I'm willing to say 'no' for a decade.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Battlefield 6's 1.1.3.0 update is bringing the fog of war into winter. As part of the new Winter Offensive, players will be able to access a new version of the Empire State map called Ice Lock Empire State. This map will only be around for a limited time, but it swaps out the standard map with frozen streets and other examples of cold and hazardous weather. The new map will also have a themed event mode, allowing you to play Domination, Conquest, and Gauntlet mission variations that utilize the new \"Freeze\" mechanic. Players will also be given access to the ice climbing axe through the Winter Offensive Bonus Path. Once they have the axe, players can unleash it as a melee weapon on unlucky foes. That bonus path also features an 11-tier, time-limited reward track featuring event cosmetics, and XP Boosters. According to Battlefield Labs, the new update has \"a broad range of fixes and refinements across Battlefield 6.\" Some of the improvements include weapon reliability, vehicle behavior, and quality-of-life bug fixes. You can find the complete notes for this update below. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Path of Exile 2 players won't have to wait long for the next update. The Last of the Druids is arriving on December 12, and it's putting more than just the magic of the Druids at your command. Players will soon be able to transform their Druids into a wolf, a bear, or even a dragon-like wyvern. The teaser trailer below demonstrates the powers that each new form has to offer. The Druid's ability to transform is tied to one of three different talismans. As a wolf, players can summon a pack to attack enemies or rip adversaries to shreds with their own teeth and claws. Bears are raw power personified, and they can increase their strength through each roar they make. Becoming a wyvern grants the player the power of flight, as well lightning and fire attacks that can bring any adversary to their knees. Even as a human, Druids have formidable abilities to fall back upon. They can command earth and storm elements, which put thunder and volcano attacks at their fingertips. There will be two paths for Druids to ascend to. As a Shaman, Druid magic and spells are amplified to a staggering degree. The Oracle may be the second ascendancy class for the Druids, but it grants players the foresight to predict enemy movements before they happen. Using those visions of the future in battle sounds like it could be very useful. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
