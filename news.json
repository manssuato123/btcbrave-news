Cross's exit comes just after the game was finally announced for a March 2026 release, following an indefinite delay prompted by underwhelming player feedback on the shooter's alpha tests. Cross's departure from Bungie was tipped by an update to his LinkedIn page and social accounts, and he confirmed to Kotaku that it was his choice to leave. \"I’m super proud of the project and what the team accomplished over the last six years,\" he said, reflecting on his exit. After years of work on Destiny as lead concept artist, Cross returned to Bungie in 2020 to help shape the visual style for Marathon. The extraction shooter is looking to be one of Bungie's most visually unique titles, with a bold aesthetic named by Cross as \"graphic realism.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Ohlen's exit comes just after the studio debuted a flashy new trailer at The Game Awards, as he says he feels his work on the game is done. Ohlen has headed up the Wizards of the Coast-owned studio since its founding in 2019, working on the studio's debut title Exodus. \"At this stage, James felt his work on the game was complete and that the polishing and tuning were in great hands with the team,\" Hasbro said in a statement given to Bloomberg. Exodus is still fairly far from release, which is currently scheduled for early 2027. This is an unusually long window if the game is already up to the polishing and tuning stage. Just last week, Exodus received an epic new trailer at The Game Awards, focused on the journey of protagonist Jun Aslan. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Riot has said the refresh will include a brand-new \"around-game\" client, entirely new visuals for Summoner's Rift, and a better experience for players new to the game--plus more updates yet to be announced. Bloomberg initially reported on Riot's plans for a 2027 LoL refresh earlier this week, saying the update was internally known as \"League Next.\" Shortly after that report was released, Riot Games confirmed the plans via a video posted to League of Legends' social media. League boss Andrei Van Roon added that the video was intended to be released in January, but had been pushed forward in response to the report. A look at some of our plans for League after 2026. pic.twitter.com/vqsnBksg1Y — League of Legends (@LeagueOfLegends) December 18, 2025 While Riot says work on the update is well underway, none of it is ready to reveal to the public just yet, though it has outlined some of the major changes on the way. First and foremost is a brand-new \"around-game\" client, which will be bundled in with the game as a single application. Summoner's Rift is also due for an overhaul, with the studio promising \"entirely new visuals\" for the classic map, as well as some new gameplay. Other gameplay updates will include changes to runes and the pre-game experience, as well as a full overhaul to the learning experience for players new to League of Legends.

    "description": "Diablo IV: The Lost Horadrim (Novel) $30 | Releases April 21, 2026 See at Amazon The world of Diablo IV will expand when the upcoming Lord of Hatred expansion launches on April 28. However, a week before the new content drops, fans will get a glimpse into the expansion's story with the prequel novel Diablo IV: The Lost Horadrim. This official novel launches on April and will provide context for the Lord of Hatred's main questline and introduce the Skovos Isles region where the expansion takes place. If that sparks your interest, you can preorder the paperback edition of Diablo IV: The Lost Horadrim for $30 at Amazon. The book will also be available as an eBook and Audible audiobook, priced at $15 and $17.52, respectively. Diablo IV: The Lost Horadrim (Novel) $30 | Releases April 21, 2026 Diablo IV: The Lost Horadrim is set in the wake of the cataclysmic reaping by the Angel of Death, Malthael, which leaves humanity and the world of Sanctuary devastated. In an effort to fight against the rising tides of Hell's forces, the Horadric Order sends Lorath, Donan, and Tyrael to the Skovos Isles to uncover the fate of a long-lost expedition. The book's events will tie into the upcoming Diablo IV expansion, Lord of Hatred. It is written by Matthew J. Kirby, who previously wrote the Diablo character tomes for Lorath and Prava. See at Amazon Diablo has a long history in print, and if you're looking to grab a few books--possibly as a devilish stocking-stuffer--there's plenty to choose from. The Diablo art books and character tomes are fun dives into the game's bleak world, combining high-quality prints with rich illustrations to create eye-catching works of art. The character tomes are designed to be in-universe books written from the perspectives of several key Diablo characters, like Cain and Prava, and they use special paper to give each book a worn, weathered look. The first four of these books are also available as part of the Horadric Vault series for $98.39, but it's actually cheaper to purchase each one and the recently released Book of Prava individually. You can also dive into various novels set within the timeline of the first Diablo game. The Sin War is a three-book series covering the conflict that would forever change the destiny of humanity, while Storm of Light is set during Diablo 3 and follows Tyrael as he enacts his boldest plan yet: rebuilding the Horadric Order and preparing them to steal the black Soulstone from the heart of Heaven. Diablo graphic novels are also available for purchase, with two of them chronicling the adventures of two legendary characters from the game series: the legendary Necromancer Rathma and the progenitor of the Barbarians, Bul-Kathos.

    "title": "Nintendo Wins Latest Round In Its 15-Year Legal Battle Over The Wii",
    "description": "Nintendo has been known to vigorously defend its interests and intellectual properties in court, and one of its longest-running legal battles may be nearing its conclusion. In 2010, the Japanese video game publisher filed a suit in Germany against BigBen Interactive--the previous incarnation of Nacon--over its third-party Wii Remote controllers. Now, the latest ruling has unequivocally gone in Nintendo's favor. As reported by Games Fray, the Mannheim Regional Court has reaffirmed the ruling that Nintendo is owed damages of over €4 million plus interest. Because Nacon fought the ruling, that interest has increased the total fee to just under €7 million. Nintendo's contention was that Nacon's Wii Remote infringed on its patents for the sensor technology and camera needed to track player movements, as well as an acceleration sensor, and \"the ergonomic features characteristic of Nintendo's Wii Remote.\" The initial verdict came down in 2011, but Nacon has consistently appealed the judgment and come up empty each time.
