Packs, themed decks, and an all-in-one tutorial game called Proving Grounds quickly sold out, and the competitive scene is starting to come into its own with tournaments popping up all over the country. PAX Unplugged served as the launching pad for the game's second set, Spiritforged, which will launch in early 2026. New cards, mechanics, and Champions were debuted during an hour-long panel led by Dave Guskin, the lead designer for Riftbound at Riot Games, and previews of new cards have popped up around the internet since then. We sat down with Dave Guskin at PAX Unplugged to learn more about internal reactions to Riftbound's release, as well as what the team has planned for Spiritforged and beyond. We also have an exclusive card from Spiritforged to reveal, with Guskin giving his thoughts on how this new Champion can best be used in battle. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The 435-piece Batman: The Animated Series Batmobile is on sale for only $38.49 (was $60). This deal is especially notable because Lego is retiring this Batman building set soon. And if you'd like the perfect background noise while piecing together the Batmobile, the Blu-ray box set collecting all 85 episodes is on sale for only $28.49 for Black Friday. Lego DC Batman: The Animated Series Batmobile (435 Pieces) $38.49 (was $60) | Retiring Soon Lego released this particular Batmobile last June alongside a few other sets, including the Batman Mech Armor that's also featured in Amazon's Black Friday Lego sale. The set is technically called Batman with the Batmobile vs. Harley Quinn and Mr. Freeze, so it won't surprise you that it comes with those three characters as minifigures. Harley Quinn wields a comically large hammer, while Mr. Freeze has a functional stud launcher. The Batman minifigure is based on his look in the show and has a molded cape. The Batmobile is over 11 inches long and has removable stud launchers, a seat for one minifigure that is accessed by lifting the cockpit hatch. A detachable exhaust flame element twirls when the wheels spin. It has everything that makes a Batmobile Lego model a playset for young Caped Crusader fans--it's recommended for builders ages 8 and up--but it doubles as a nice display piece thanks to the included 360-degree rotatable stand and information placard that's more commonly seen with Lego models designed for adults. See at Amazon Batman: The Complete Animated Series on Blu-ray $28.49 (was $80) Batman: The Complete Animated Series actually includes even more than just the 85-episode series that ran from 1992-1995. It also comes with all 24 episodes of The New Adventures of Batman, Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, and Batman and Mr. Freeze. Fans should also check out the Blu-ray box set deals for three other animated series: Batman Beyond (1999), The Batman (2004), and the classic Adventures of Batman (1968).

    "description": "At the beginning of 2025, Hypergryph shared the first closed beta test for Arknights: Endfield, the free-to-play action-RPG spin-off from the Arknights franchise. Now, the second beta test has begun, and it appears to be a considerable upgrade over the game's previous state. This work-in-progress build has \"50-60 hours worth of polished content,\"a rebuilt storyline, fresh cutscenes and more according to Hypergryph. The combat has also been refined and there's a new region, Wuling, that's now ripe for exploration. The game casts players as the Endministrator, the leader of Endfield Industries who has no memory of the past. As the Endmin reclaims their life, they fight alongside companions and attempt to explore and exploit the wild planet Talos-II. Much like Satisfactory, players can extract resources from the planet and build factories to fully utilize the materials they have at hand. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

See at Amazon If you've been waiting for a discount on Lego's Pac-Man Arcade, you're in luck: The 2,651-piece retro arcade cabinet model is featured in Amazon's Black Friday 2025 Lego sale. The nostalgic officially licensed Pac-Man Arcade is available for $189 (was $270). The $81 discount is the best deal yet for the Pac-Man Arcade, which launched in June 2023. This extremely cool Lego building set for adults almost always sells for full price, and the few deals we've seen over the past two-plus years have sold out fast. Lego Icons: Pac-Man Arcade (2,651 Pieces) $189 (was $270) Part of the Lego Icons series, Pac-Man Arcade is a brick-built countertop machine model measuring 10 x 7 x 13 inches. Out of all of Lego's gaming system sets, Pac-Man Arcade is probably the most impressive from a design perspective. And it's definitely the coolest when it comes to interactive features. It has a movable four-way joystick, and you can press the two dome buttons. The crank on the side of the cabinet moves Pac-Man through the mechanical maze while Blinky and Clyde chase him. The coin slot uses a light brick that makes it look like the real thing. In addition to the cabinet itself, it comes with buildable Pac-Man, Blinky, and Clyde figures that attach to a stand that connects to the top of the cabinet. Rounding out the set is a minifigure-scale '80s arcade scene, complete with a tiny brick-built Pac-Man cabinet and a gamer minifigure wearing vintage clothes. You can store the scene inside the cabinet by removing the back panel. This also allows you to watch the mechanical components in motion while turning the crank.

    "title": "4K Blu-Ray Editions Of Superman, F1, And Jurassic World Rebirth Are $13 For Black Friday",
    "description": "Superman (4K Blu-ray) $12.49 (was $35) See at Amazon F1: The Movie (4K Blu-ray) $12.49 (was $30) See at Amazon Jurassic World Rebirth: Collector's Edition (4K Blu-ray) $13.49 (was $30) See at Amazon A whole bunch of recently released 4K Blu-ray films are discounted for Black Friday, including three popular movies that are now available for their lowest price ever--Superman, F1: The Movie, and Jurassic World Rebirth. These Black Friday deals won't stick around much longer, so if you're interested in adding them to your collection for cheap, swing by Amazon and check them out soon. Superman (4K Blu-ray) $12.49 (was $35) Superman hit theaters in July, and now you can bring it home for $12.49 (was $35). You'll get a 4K Blu-ray and digital copy of the film, plus over 90 minutes of bonus features. This includes behind-the-scenes featurettes like \"Adventures in the Making of Superman\" and an animated short. Both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos are supported, making this the most premium way to enjoy the superhero flick in your home theater. See at Amazon F1: The Movie (4K Blu-ray) $12.49 (was $30) Starring Brad Pitt and directed by Joseph Kosinski, director of Top Gun: Maverick, F1: The Movie earned high praise for its impressive visuals and special effects--if you're a racing fan, it's certainly worth checking out. Beyond 4K Blu-ray and digital copies of the movie, you'll get special features such as the \"Inside the F1: The Movie Table Read\" and a look at sets and locations from around the world. Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos are once again supported. See at Amazon Jurassic World Rebirth: Collector's Edition (4K Blu-ray) $13.49 (was $30) This Collector's Edition comes with 4K Blu-ray, standard Blu-ray, and digital copies of Jurassic World Rebirth. Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos are supported, and you'll find over an hour of bonus features packed into the bundle. This includes deleted scenes, an alternate opening, and a making-of documentary, among plenty of other featurettes. Starring Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali, it earned mixed reviews (but no doubt it's a fun summer blockbuster). See at Amazon While the 4K Blu-ray deals are arguably the most enticing, two of the above films are also available for cheap on standard Blu-ray. The Superman Blu-ray is $9.49 (was $30), and it gets you all the same bonus features as its fancier 4K sibling. It also supports Dolby Atmos. F1: The Movie on Blu-ray is also $9.49 (was $25), once again getting you the same bonus features as the 4K edition, plus support for Dolby Atmos. But since the 4K version of both these films is just a few bucks more expensive, most shoppers will probably find them to be the better option than standard Blu-ray. And if you want to add even more movies to your home theater, check out the Criterion Collection Black Friday Sale at Amazon, which is offering 50% discounts on hundreds of iconic films.
