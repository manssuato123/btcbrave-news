Ever since he went viral in 2022 for enthusiastically playing the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 medley on a strange-looking tenor flute, Eustache has been a regular feature of The Game Awards. Each year he seems to get more dedicated airtime during the orchestral section, playing bigger and more unusual flutes. Pedro Eustache playing a strange new flute during the Clair Obscur tribute2025, of course, is no different, with Eustache even getting his own announcement video on The Game Awards' social media pages in the lead up to the show. His appearance in the orchestral section didn't disappoint, with his flute part highlighted through the Death Stranding 2 arrangement, and his part in the Clair Obscur section played on a strange new flute that appears to be made out of PVC pipe.

Orbitals is a two-player co-op adventure, where players step into the roles of Maki and Omura to save their home from a supernatural cosmic storm. Aside from showing off the game's gorgeous '80s anime-inspired visuals, Orbitals' debut trailer also highlights how Maki and Omura will traverse space and work together to solve puzzles. In one example of how the game's co-op will work, the trailer shows one character piloting a spaceship while another operates the ship's turret. Another portion of the trailer highlights one of the duo using a levitating beam to help transport some important piece of a puzzle, while the other navigates a series of dangerous platforms.

    "description": "As The Game Awards 2025 came to a close, we got one more surprise: Wildlight--a team of devs led by folks who previously worked on Titanfall 2 and Apex Legends--announced its new game: Highguard. Not only that, the game will be playable in a few weeks. A gameplay trailer showcased that Highguard leans into Apex Legends' hero shooter formula but takes it in a different direction, opting for an objective-based raid shooter as opposed to a kill-or-be-killed battle royale. The narrative direction of the game is different too, opting for something that looks more high fantasy (like horses, magic, and pet familiars) while still maintaining that science-fiction flair when it comes to the various characters' abilities and firearms. On Steam, Highguard is described as a \"PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent. [Players will battle] rival Warden crews for possession of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure territory in this all-new breed of shooter.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Hold on, let me explain. Game director Guillaume Broche took to the stage at the end of The Game Awards to accept the GOTY trophy on behalf of the team at Sandfall Interactive. While commenting that the outfit--a traditional French garb replete with a black-and-white striped shirt and a red beret--started as a joke and thanking the team, publisher Kepler Interactive, and the cast, Broche had a couple more people in mind to give special thanks to. \"And also, I want to extend [my] thanks to the unsung heroes of this industry,\" he said during his roughly five-minute speech. \"The people who make tutorials on YouTube on how to make a game because we had no idea how to make a game before.

At The Game Awards, the first look at Mega Man's next game was revealed. It's called Mega Man Dual Override, and its retains the side-scrolling action of the original games with updated visuals that pop off the screen. Mega Man Dual Override will arrive in 2027, which dovetails with the 40th anniversary of the original Mega Man that debuted in 1987. The title character is a heroic robot who is able to steal certain powers and abilities from bosses he defeats, allowing him to use them against the other bosses. The games even let players strategize which bosses to go after first to determine which enemies were vulnerable to his newfound weapons. Six Mega Man games were released on the NES before the series went to the SNES with Mega Man 7 in 1995. The spin-off series, Mega Man X, also debuted on the SNES, and the franchise continued in various forms through 2018 and the debut of Mega Man 11. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Expedition 33 also received awards for Best Narrative, Best Game Direction, Best Art Direction, Best Score and Music, Best Independent Game, Best Debut Indie Game, Best Performance (Jennifer English), and Best RPG.

    "description": "Upcoming gacha-RPG game Arknights: Endfield will release on January 22, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile, as revealed in a music-video trailer at The Game Awards 2025. The Arknights spin-off features action-RPG gameplay in a semi-open world, mixed with elements of factory simulation like Satisfactory--and, of course, plenty of anime girls for its gacha system. The release date was dropped at the end of a trailer, which also doubled as a music video, revealing Endfield's title track Give Me Something for the very first time. The track is performed by American band OneRepublic, who also appeared in the trailer alongside Endfield's cast of launch characters. Endfield is a spin-off from tower defense game Arknights, moving away from the franchise's origins with more traditional action-RPG mechanics. Setting it apart from the many other anime-style gacha RPGs that spawned from Genshin Impact's success, Endfield also includes elements of strategic management, with factory-simulation mechanics similar to Factorio or Satisfactory.

    "title": "Chinese Martial-Arts RPG Phantom Blade Zero Gets September 2026 Release Date",
    "description": "At The Game Awards, developer S-Game has released a new trailer for its upcoming action game, Phantom Blade Zero, confirming a release date of September 9, 2026 on PC and PlayStation 5. The trailer was pretty epic, starting with some CGI of a martial artist crossing swords with some thugs while carrying a baby in some Death Stranding kind of way. We then cut to some actual gameplay of our protagonist, the elite assassin Soul, as he travels around various environments, enters various cutscenes, and engages in various battles. It's not quite a souls-like, but based on combat encounters and enemy designs, you'd think it was one. Actually, it looks like a cool mix between Where Winds Meet, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty. First announced back in 2023, Phantom Blade Zero is one of several high-profile games inspired by '80s and '90s Chinese Wuxia action movies. Phantom Blade Zero features a seamless map with interconnected regions for players to explore. This aspect of the game was inspired by classic Dark Souls, while combat revolves around fast-paced offense and even quicker blocks against your usual cannon-fodder enemies and tougher bosses.
