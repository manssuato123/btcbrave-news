    "title": "Fan Theories Link Pokemon Pokopia To Older Games In The Franchise",
    "description": "When it was announced in September 2025, Pokemon Pokopia appeared to be the franchise's cozy-game answer to Animal Crossing and Minecraft. But after the recently released extended trailer for the game, fans have pointed out intriguing and dark links to some of the previous titles in the franchise. It's almost unsettling that one of the first things seen in the extended trailer is a devastated Pokemon Center and a generation-one Pokedex. As noted on Reddit (via Eurogamer), one of the fan theories suggests that Pokopia is set on Cinnabar Island from the Kanto region, which was originally featured in Pokemon Blue, Red, and Yellow. As depicted in Pokemon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, Cinnabar Island was devastated by a volcano eruption that left a Pokemon Center as one of the last remaining structures, much like the one glimpsed in Pokopia's trailer. Professor Tangrowth--a character introduced in the trailer--mentions that he hasn't seen humans in a long time, but the island has other evidence that people once lived there including roads and other buildings. The strange Pokemon variations introduced in the trailer--like the stark-white Pikachu known as Peakychu--may have been created at Cinnabar Island's Pokemon Mansion. Perhaps not coincidentally, Pokemon Mansion was the place where Ditto could be found in the original Pokemon games. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Internet (And Gaming) Icon Strong Bad Returns With New Email After Three Years",
    "description": "After three years of mysteriously absent email-checking, Strong Bad has finally smashed his boxing-gloved fists onto the keyboard once more, returning with a brand-new message for his loyal fans. And in true Strong Bad fashion, it's about robots--again--and this time they apparently want to discuss their favorite sauces. His comeback feels like stepping back into Free Country, USA itself: chaotic, ridiculous, and somehow still deeply important to a generation. It also offers the perfect opportunity to revisit the era when Strong Bad and the rest of the Homestar Runner cast broke out of browser windows and into full-fledged video games. The most defining gaming moment for the franchise came with the Telltale game Strong Bad’s Cool Game for Attractive People, a five-episode point-and-click adventure released throughout 2008. The game played like an interactive Homestar Runner cartoon, built in close collaboration with the Brothers Chaps, who supplied writing, design input, and voice work. Guiding Strong Bad through his latest harebrained schemes--from band competitions to clumsy attempts at political takeover--gave fans a new way to revel in the character's larger-than-life personality, all while exploring familiar territory like the House of Strong and Bubs' Concession Stand. A large part of the game's charm came from its faithfulness to the original Flash cartoons. While it followed Telltale's traditional adventure formula, the world was loaded with oddball interactions, surreal conversations, and puzzles that functioned less on logic and more on the internal rules of Homestar Runner's absurdity. Each episode came packed with extra features, such as bizarre arcade minigames, collectible Teen Girl Squad cards, and hidden Easter eggs that rewarded longtime fans who had practically memorized the old website.

The Game Business described Black Ops 7's European launch as \"disappointing,\" citing GSD, which tracks physical and digital sales data. Sales numbers for Black Ops 7's opening week are 63% below those of Battlefield 6, and The Game Business also estimates that sales are over 50% down compared to last year's Black Ops 6. Even still, the GSD numbers indicate that Black Ops 7 was still the top-selling game in Europe during its opening week. Despite Japan not being a key market for the Call of Duty franchise, sales numbers there show a similar trend, with Insider Gaming reporting that Black Ops 7 had the worst Japanese launch in the franchise's history.

    "description": "Bethesda did a shadowdrop for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered earlier this year, and it was a big success. Another Bethesda-published game, Hi-Fi Rush, had a shadowdrop as well. Now, Bethesda Game Studios director Tom Mustaine is openly calling for more releases of this type in the future from other developers across the industry. Speaking to GamesRadar, Mustaine said the shadowdrop approach is a favorite of Bethesda boss Todd Howard, and releasing games like this can be a way to reach players who may have short attention spans. \"We all have short attention spans now,\" he said. \"There's Grand Theft Auto, for example. I want that today, right? So it is an interesting strategy ... I don't have any ideas of what would be next, but I hope it's not the last. Personally, I think it was great to own the internet for that day and, you know, give people exactly what they want the moment we talk about it. I'm a fan of that personally, but I'd love to see more people do it.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Actor Charlie Cox was nominated for Best Performance at this year's Game Awards for his role as Gustave in the breakout hit Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. He's now reacted to receiving that nomination, saying he is thrilled, but also making it clear that the credit ought to go to the performance-capture actor, Maxence Cazorla. \"I am thrilled for this nomination,\" Cox said at the La Conve/Animex event in Mexico recently. \"There is an amazing French actor by the name of Maxence Cazorla who did almost all of the motion capture for that role in that game. Any nomination, or any credit I get, I have to give to him. I believe the performance of that character is really down to him and my voice was just a part of that process.\" Charlie talking about his nomination at #TheGameAwards pic.twitter.com/hfWkH9IDQy — Ann 👻 (@bursinxmurdock) November 22, 2025 Cox was nominated for Best Performance alongside two other Expedition 33 actors, including Ben Starr and Jennifer English. Erika Ishii was nominated for Ghost of Yotei, Konatsu Kato for Silent Hill f, and Troy Baker for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
