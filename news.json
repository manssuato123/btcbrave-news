    "description": "Arcade1Up NBA Jam Deluxe Cabinet $400 (was $500) See at Amazon See at Best Buy Nostalgic NBA Jam fans can save big on Arcade1Up's home arcade machine featuring the classic 2v2 basketball game. The NBA Jam Deluxe Arcade Cabinet is on sale for an all-time low price of $400 (was $500) at Amazon and Best Buy. The $100 discount is one of several notable last-minute holiday deals on Arcade1Up machines. We've included a list of the other Arcade1Up deals at the bottom of this story. Arcade1Up NBA Jam Deluxe Cabinet $400 (was $500) The NBA Jam Deluxe Cabinet is preloaded with three classic arcade basketball games developed by Midway from 1993-1996: NBA Jam, NBA Jam Tournament Edition, and NBA Hangtime. The control deck has two sets of inputs: one arcade stick and three buttons for each player. In addition to local multiplayer, you can play against users around the world over Wi-Fi. Like other Deluxe editions from Arcade1Up, it has a 17-inch HD display, light-up marquee, dual stereo speakers, and a faux coin door on the front. The cabinet is roughly 61.5 inches tall, just under 19 inches wide, and weighs approximately 62 pounds. If you want to sit while playing, Amazon has a limited-time deal on this popular adjustable bar stool with a backrest. Arcade1Up has manufactured several NBA Jam cabinets over the past five years, but the Deluxe Edition is the only model in stores today. Outside of Arcade1Up cabinets, NBA Jam has been dormant for nearly 15 years; the last home console entry, NBA Jam: On Fire Edition, released on PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2011. Thankfully, Arcade1Up's NBA Jam cabinet offers an authentic way to revisit the best entries in the series. See at Amazon See at Best Buy Arcade1Up Cabinets and Countercades Check out all deals and in-stock products. See at Amazon See at Best Buy NBA Jam debuted exclusively in arcades in 1993 and was ported to consoles the following year. The Tournament Edition, which launched in 1994, is essentially an updated and expanded version of the original NBA Jam. As the name suggests, the main addition was Tournament mode. It's still 2v2 basketball, but Midway added a third player to each team, allowing you to make substitutions throughout each game. The Tournament Edition also expanded player stat categories. NBA Hangtime was developed by the same team at Midway, just with a different title because the NBA Jam moniker was sold to Acclaim Entertainment. Midway once again expanded the rosters to five players and introduced a custom player creator, but NBA Hangtime is still very much an NBA Jam game. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The Marvel's Spider-Man Bundle, which has been hard to find at Amazon for more than a month, was restocked December 19 for $48.49 (was $70)--and promptly sold out again. Thankfully, Target still has units available for the same price. The bundle comes with nine Play Booster Packs, an Alternate-Art Foil Promo Card, 30 Basic Land Cards, a Spider-Man-themed storage box, and a few other items.

Both Marvel's Spider-Man booster boxes are on sale for roughly $100 off. The Play Booster Box has dropped all the way down to $112, which means each of the 30 Booster Packs will cost you an average of $3.73.

    "description": "While Sony and Nintendo have expanded their lead over Xbox, a dark horse console had a very strong showing in third place in November. The Nex Playground has emerged as a breakout hit, and CEO David Lee believes that one of the reasons why its been so successful is because the console has solved the Wii \"problem.\" Nearly two decades ago, the Wii powered Nintendo's post-GameCube comeback with its motion controls and unique games. Lee argues that the scope of Wii's success made it difficult to sustain in the long term. Instead of trying to sell games like Wii, Nex Playground is offering its titles as part of a subscription service. \"One of the most important things we should do is learn from history and try not to commit the same limitations, and that's why we have a subscription model,\" Lee told The Game Business. \"Nintendo expanded the audience with Wii. When you expand the audience, and they want different things, and they only buy Wii Fit, Wii Sports and not many others … that's a bit of a problem.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Save Up To 25% On The Akira Manga Hardcover Edition",
    "description": "Akira Hardcover Collection Save Up To 25% See all volumes at Amazon Any list gathering up the best that anime has to offer will inevitably include Akira, and for good reason. The 1988 movie raised the bar for film animation and is widely credited with introducing mainstream audiences outside Japan to the medium. However, the anime adaptation is only part of the tale. Like innumerable other anime projects, Akira is adapted from a much longer--though lesser-known--manga series. While the Akira manga has been available in print for decades, a new Akira Hardcover Edition kicked off earlier in 2025, offering the most authentic presentation of Katsuhiro Otomo's groundbreaking sci-fi saga. If you've ever wanted to experience the full Akira saga, this is one of the best ways to do so--and as luck would have it, you can save a few dollars on these premium hardcover releases. Four volumes in the six-volume series are available to purchase at Amazon, and while these normally cost between $30 and $40, you can get them for up 25% off. Volumes 5 and 6 are also launching in the coming weeks, and preorders are live. Akira Hardcover Collection Save Up To 25% The Akira Hardcover books published by Kodansha use the updated translation and lettering of the 35th Anniversary Edition box set, and each book is presented as a large-sized 7\" x 10\" collectible. Like traditional manga, they are read from right to left, and the original Japanese-language hand-drawn sound effects from the manga have been restored. Each hardcover book has cover artwork based on the original manga tankabon volume artwork. As mentioned above, four volumes have launched so far, and are currently discounted to roughly $26 - $27 at Amazon (normally $30 - $35 each). The next release, Akira Hardcover Collection 5, releases on December 23. Preorders are discounted to $34 (down from $36). This will be followed by Akira Hardcover Collection 6, a month later on January 27, 2026. Preorders for volume six are available for $40. Check out all the Akira Hardcover Collection releases below. Akira Hardcover Collection 1 -- $26.61 ($35) Akira Hardcover Collection 2 -- $26.61 ($35) Akira Hardcover Collection 3 -- $25.70 ($30) Akira Hardcover Collection 4 -- $27.61 ($35) Akira Hardcover Collection 5 -- $34 ($36) | Releases December 23 Akira Hardcover Collection 6 -- $40 | Releases January 27, 2026 See all volumes at Amazon While the hardcover editions above are fresh reprints, you can also pick up all six of them as part of the Akira 35th Anniversary Manga Box Set. All six volumes come bundled together with the hardcover Akira Club art book and an exclusive pill patch. It's currently sold out, but it gets restocked periodically at Amazon, so it's worth checking back to see if it's available. Set in a dark future timeline, Akira first began publication in 1982 and ran for 120 chapters. Taking place in the post-apocalyptic city of Neo-Tokyo, the series examines the after-effects of a mysterious explosion that almost destroyed the city. Thirty years later, teenage biker gang leader Shotaro Kaneda finds himself in the middle of a plot that involves militant revolutionaries, psychically gifted individuals, military forces, and his childhood friend, Tetsuo Shima, who has begun to develop dangerously destructive psychic powers of his own. Akira manga was critically acclaimed for its mature themes, well-developed characters, intriguing storylines, and Otomo's artwork. In the years since its publication, it's become regarded as one of the pioneering works in the then-burgeoning Cyberpunk sci-fi subgenre. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Players can collect all eight items and bring them to the Block to watch Stray Kids perform and receive additional free items from the band. However, this event will only run until 10 AM PT/1 PM ET on Monday, December 22. In other Roblox-related news, the platform has been banned in Russia and accused of negatively impacting children, and apparently considers the dissemination of LGBTQIA+ content to be a crime.

    "description": "Totally Awesome 80s Box Set (4K) $55 See at Amazon It's the most festive time of the year, and if you're looking to do some last-minute gift-shopping, what's better than a bundle of classic '80s action movies? Available exclusively on Amazon, cinephiles--or shoppers looking to get something for their dad--can grab the Totally Awesome 80s 4K Blu-ray bundle. The collection, which launched just a few days ago on December 16, includes 4K Blu-ray editions of five acclaimed 1980s films, plus bonus materials and digital streaming copies of each movie. The Totally Awesome 80s bundle in stock and available for $55 at Amazon. Totally Awesome 80s Box Set (4K) $55 The Totally Awesome 80s Box Set compiles 4K Blu-ray editions of five classic movies released by Paramount Pictures throughout the 1980s: Beverly Hills Cop Ferris Bueller's Day Off Top Gun Trading Places The Untouchables That's a nice selection of some of the decade's most notable action, comedy, and drama flicks. The 4K Blu-ray releases for each film support Dolby Vision, HDR10, and Dolby Atmos audio, and offer their own selection of bonus materials, including new behind-the-scenes documentaries, deleted scenes, music videos, audio commentary tracks, and more. See at Amazon If you've never seen these films, then you've missed out on some of the most influential movies of all time. Top Gun was a blockbuster hit that cemented Tom Cruise's stardom, combining incredible aerial photography and action set against some of the era's chart-topping pop and rock songs. Ferris Bueller's Day Off, one of John Hughes' best films, follows Bueller (Mathew Broderick), his girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara), and his best bud Cameron (Alan Ruck) as they take an unscheduled break from school. The Untouchables is a ruthless turn-of-the-century gangster movie with an all-star cast, while Trading Places saw John Landis put his own spin on Wall Street, and Beverly Hills Cop is a breakout action-comedy hit that made Eddie Murphy a household name. Lots more vintage movie Blu-rays are currently on sale, if you're hunting for easy stocking-stuffers. James Bond fans can pick up various bundles dedicated to different 007 eras, or for a license to thrill, there's The James Bond Collection of 24-film Blu-rays for only $55 (was $120).
