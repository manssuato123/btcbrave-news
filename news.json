    "description": "Rockstar's highly anticipated open-world game GTA 6 was supposed to be released around right now, in Fall 2025, but the game has seen multiple delays since it was originally announced. Now, the game is slated for release in about a year on November 19, 2026, following a pushback from May 26, 2026. Why was GTA 6 delayed a second time? And how does the delay pattern for GTA 6 line up with Rockstar's previous releases? We're breaking down all the key things to know in this post. Rockstar's rationale for delaying GTA 6 In early November, Rockstar announced that GTA 6 was being delayed by 5 months and 24 days, from May 26 to November 19. But why did Rockstar make the decision to delay the game once again? The company said it came down to quality. \"These extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve,\" the studio said.

PUBG: Black Budget is introducing more sci-fi and fantasy elements by setting the action on Coli, an island that is locked in a repeating time loop while under threat from the Anomaly, a supernatural phenomenon of unknown origin. The game will also place an emphasis on \"exploration and discovery\" instead of relying on non-stop combat. Players are tasked with finding \"top-secret technology\" while attempting to learn more about SAPIENS, a black-budget initiative. The matches will will consist of PvPvE battles. Promo art for PUBG: Black Budget.Gallery Info about signing up for the closed alpha test is already on Steam, and the event will last for six days spread across two weeks.

    "title": "This Pokemon Meets Fall Guys Game Was Saved After Wizards Of The Coast Cancelled It",
    "description": "In February 2023, Wizards of the Coast closed an internal game development studio, and with it cancelled multiple unannounced titles, one of them being Whimpact!, a \"Pokemon meets Fall Guys\" online multiplayer game. Rather than let it die, Leah Hoyer, who was at the time VP of creative for WotC, opened her own studio called Level Headed Games, acquired the rights to Whimpact!, and continued development--and it's set to release in early access soon. Whimpact! drops players into the world of Whims, cute little creatures that pass along magical powers to those who collect and care for them. The more they're cared for, the stronger those powers will be. Up to eight players will be able to join together in co-op arena-style gameplay as they collect Whims, gather mystical energy called Starcane, and navigate obstacles while fighting hordes of robotic invaders trying to steal the energy for themselves. Gallery There are seven different types of Whims to collect, each with six different color variants. The power each Whim gives the player will depend on its color, with powers including increased speed, increased strength, high jumping ability, longer jumping ability, and more.

    "description": "Hitman developer IO Interactive, which has a new game--007: First Light--coming out in March 2026, has commented on Rockstar's decision to delay GTA 6 from May 2026 to November 2026. IO CEO Hakan Abrak was asked by GI.biz if he feels pleased that GTA 6 moved further away from 007: First Light. \"It would be a lie not to say that obviously spring looks really good,\" he said of 007: First Light's release window. The game launches on March 27, which was about two months before GTA 6's May 26 release date before Rockstar pushed the game to November 19, 2026. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "For the first time, CloverPit is available on console after surprise-releasing yesterday on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox Game Pass (Ultimate and Premium tiers). The slot machine roguelike takes inspiration from Balatro and Buckshot Roulette, even featuring Jimbo from the former in the new Xbox launch trailer seen below. Players are tasked with paying off their gambling debt from inside a disgusting cell, and if they can't, they take a terrible tumble. CloverPit originally came out on Steam on September 26. It was one of the games that actually delayed its release to avoid Hollow Knight: Silksong on September 4. CloverPit planned to launch September 3 initially. That change of course seems to have played out favorably for the roguelike, as publisher Future Friends Games and developer Panik Arcade have stated CloverPit has sold over 1 million copies on Steam so far. Panik Arcade teased new DLC for CloverPit in the Xbox launch trailer as well. On X, the developer notes that the add-on will be named Unholy Fusion and will release on PC and Xbox. However, it's unknown at this time if it will be free or paid DLC. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The Xbox Partner Preview showed off a bunch of cool and interesting projects coming to Xbox consoles and PC in the future, including Armatus, The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu, and Raji: Kaliyuga. However, the event itself bucked an annoying trend that other trailer showcases continue to follow, as each trailer that aired during the event showed the logos for every console the game will launch on, not just Xbox. Traditionally, when a game makes an appearance during one of these events, the final shot confirms the game for the host company's consoles--PlayStation consoles for Sony, the Switch or Switch 2 for Nintendo, and so on. However, in yesterday's event the PS5 and Nintendo Switch 2 logos appeared multiple times throughout the showcase. The final shot from the Armatus trailer that aired during the Xbox Partner Preview.Of the 16 titles shown during the Xbox Partner Preview, 13 of them included either a PlayStation or Nintendo Switch logo in their ending graphic. The three exceptions were Echo Generation 2, Roadside Research, and Cloverpit, but all three of them are, as of this writing, only coming to Xbox consoles. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Those titular fruits are the keys to success, but not only are some rarer than others, but vendors constantly change their wares, so we’re here to explain everything you need to know about the Blox Fruits stock as well as restock times. Table of Contents [hide]What is the Blox Fruits Stock System? What is the Blox Fruits Stock System? The most important part of Blox Fruit is, unsurprisingly, those titular Blox Fruits. If you want to expand your collection, you will need to amass some money through regular gameplay and then head to a vendor to buy Blox Fruit. Sadly, not all of the Blox Fruit are available at once, and their appearance is dictated by their rarity. So, you’re much more likely to see common Blox Fruit than you are rare ones. Anyone wanting to expand their abilities or collect all of the Blox Fruit will need to routinely visit the in-game vendors with the hopes of eventually finding and purchasing every Blox Fruit in the game. Regular vendors have at least three Blox Fruit, while the Advanced Fruit Dealer on Mirage Island holds five. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The era of console wars seems to be nearing its end, but one of its key players, Peter Moore, who led the charge during the launch of the Xbox 360, is sharing his memories of his time on the gaming frontlines. When it came to pitting the Xbox 360 against the PlayStation 3, Moore says 10 million was the magic number--\"You've got this flywheel effect ... of [if] your mate in the school yard's got one, you better get one.\" Speaking to Eurogamer, Moore explained that getting the Xbox 360 into the market ahead of the PS3 was key to its strong performance, saying that the first 10 million sales were vital. \"I think it was really important to get it out first,\" Moore said. \"Get going, get momentum, and aim for that 10 million installed base that I felt that would give us an amazing advantage over whatever Sony could do to catch up.\" He explained that having the 10 million install base creates a network effect where a sense of social pressure could drive sales--\"All of a sudden you're out of place and you're on the outside if you're not coming to school, or going to class in college the next day, or even coming to work, and saying what a night we had playing Halo, or whatever game it happened to be.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",
