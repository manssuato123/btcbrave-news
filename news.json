    "description": "What's next for the Hitman franchise? Developer IO Interactive isn't spilling the beans on its future plans for Agent 47, but the studio has confirmed that Hitman 3--now known as Hitman: World of Assassination following a 2023 rebranding--won't be the final entry in the franchise. In a new interview, IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak stated that news on the series will be revealed in due time, alongside details on the upcoming co-op mode for World of Assassination. \"Of course, there will be more Hitman,\" Abrak said to Variety. \"But right now, I think we need to get to the other side of this year, and next year you'll get more news about Hitman co-op, because I think co-op is a really, really good extension to the universe and will introduce very interesting mechanics and combinations in World of Assassination. But we will after that be talking about the next Hitman--because, of course, there’s going to be a next Hitman.\" IO Interactive's upcoming James Bond game--007: First Light--launches in March 2026. Hitman: World of Assassination has received substantial post-launch support while the studio worked on its 007 game, with the most recent being a new Elusive Target mission that teams Agent 47 up with Eminem to kill the rapper's dangerous alter ego, Slim Shady. Senior level designer Håkan Almer and writer Jen Simpkins added that the mission will involve Eminem serving as a source of intel alongside Agent 47's handler, Diane Burnwood.

    "title": "The Witcher 4 Still Has Two Sequels Planned Within Six Years, CD Projekt Red Asserts",
    "description": "There's still no release date or window for The Witcher 4. But that's not stopping CD Projekt Red from stating again that a whole new trilogy might launch within a six-year timespan. That's been the plan for years, but the company reasserted this position during a recent financial call, according to Eurogamer. CD Projekt co-CEO Michal Nowakowski was asked about the company utilizing Unreal Engine 5 for The Witcher 4 and whether that could lead to shorter development cycles for future sequels. \"In a way, yes, I do believe that further games should be delivered in a shorter period of time--as we had stated before, our plan still is to launch the whole trilogy within a six-year period, so yes, that would mean we would plan to have a shorter development time between [The Witcher 4] and [The Witcher] 5, between [The Witcher] 5 and [The Witcher] 6 and so on,\" Nowakowski said. Nowakowski's co-CEO at CD Projekt, Adam Kicinski, discussed this six-year timespan for the new Witcher trilogy in 2022--over three years ago. To be clear, the clock would start ticking on six years once The Witcher 4 launches, and that won't happen until 2027 at the earliest. If, for example, The Witcher 4 did come out then, that would mean CD Projekt aims for The Witcher 5 to hit in 2030 and The Witcher 6 in 2033. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Several months have passed since the release of Silent Hill F, and thanks to online chatter, memes, and an active community, the survival-horror game is still trending. That's according to Silent Hill series producer Motoi Okamoto and writer Ryukishi07, who recently spoke about how Silent Hill F continues to stay in the spotlight. \"Recently, discourse about games is being consumed at a rapid pace,\" Okamoto said to Dengeki Online (via Automaton), . \"But games that do get talked about even months after release are the ones that are fun to theorize about and analyze, and they usually get a lot of character fan art.

As an encore, Team Cherry has confirmed that there will be DLC released for Silksong. Just don't expect it too soon. \"I don't really know what else people would necessarily want to hear other than what we're already saying,\" Team Cherry co-founder Ari Gibson told Bloomberg. \"Yes, we're continuing to work on the game, we're pursuing the things that excite us ... I think what people might want to hear is: There will be new stuff coming in a reasonable timeframe and not seven years from now.\" Gibson went on to explain that he and Team Cherry co-founder William Pellen \"might have some vague ideas\" for the DLC, but added that he didn't want to \"overpromise\" and underdeliver to the game's fans. He also teased the return of Steel Assassin Sharpe, an enemy character from the first game. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Battlefield Studios has released an update on Battlefield 6's anticheat, now that we're one month into the popular shooter's first season. The statistics look highly impressive for the studio's campaign against cheaters, claiming that only 2% of total matches were likely to have been impacted by cheating. Instead of reporting on anticheat by the number of cheaters caught or banned, Battlefield Studios uses a metric it calls \"Match Infection Rate,\" or MIR, calculated around the likelihood that at least one cheater impacted the results of a given match. The studio reports a MIR of just 2% in the week following launch, which means an impressive 98% of matches were cheat-free. In the month following BF6's launch, the MIR has fluctuated a little, but has stayed mostly between 2% and 3%. The studio reports that EA's Javelin Anticheat has blocked more then 2.39 million cheat attempts to date since release--comparably less than the open beta, which saw over 1.2 million cheats blocked in under 10 days.

    "description": "Crossovers between rival movie studios are few and far between, but Fortnite just pulled off one for the ages. During the recent Zero Hour finale, Fortnite brought together Superman, Ironman, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the Power Rangers, Invincible, Street Fighter's Chun Li, Mortal Kombat's Scorpion and Sub Zero, and even a giant Homer Simpson for the final battle. Now, Epic Games co-founder Mark Rein is taking a bow and explaining how he helped make it happen. Superman, Iron Man, Invincible, Homer, Godzilla, Optimus Prime, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the Power Rangers, Sub Zero, Scorpion &amp; more team up in an ‘Avengers: Endgame’ style sequence in Fortnite. pic.twitter.com/wROpgDJgdg — DiscussingFilm (@DiscussingFilm) November 29, 2025 In a post on X, Rein noted that he negotiated the deals that brought these characters into Fortnite and acknowledged his \"great legal team.\" But he attributed the willingness to let the crossover happen to the Fortnite developers for winning the trust of the studios. \"It was mostly the vision of our design and development team combined with bravery of our partners that made this all possible,\" wrote Rein. \"Imagine the audacity of what we were asking them to do with their beloved and sacred intellectual property and the trust that required in us! Yet they all came on board and cooperate in ways that continue to delight millions of people every day. We have truly amazing partners and in many ways we're still just getting started!!\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Everstone Studios' free-to-play action-adventure-RPG Where Winds Meet is a game that gives over many of its NPC conversations to chatbots. But these NPCs aren't necessarily smarter because they're AI. In fact, players have discovered some easy-to-exploit loopholes in the chat model that convinces NPCs to hand over their side-quest loot or money even when you haven't done anything at all. Players on Reddit noticed that the AI-powered chatbot NPCs often put their emotional responses and actions in parentheses. That led to the discovery that telling an NPC that you did something to fulfill their quest inside of a parentheses will cause the NPC to believe you've already done it. And the game rewards players for that deception by having the NPC hand over whatever item they promised the player for their help. At first, I tried to speak normally to the chatbots, but then I realized you have the power of (divine truth) byu/Proximis inWhereWindsMeet While Everstone may eventually fix that workaround, it's not the only way to mislead the NPCs. Another user on Reddit found that repeating the NPC's last statement as a question can eventually wear it down until it hands over the item. The user called it, \"the Metal Gear method.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Lemay-Comtois went on to explain that while there will still be post-launch content for Shadows, \"It's not a full-on DLC the way a season pass would have had in the previous years ... Any content we want to do in Year Two will probably be more sparse, not a drip-feed... but chunkier updates that shake things up a little more. I'm not announcing anything at this point, but our strategy for Year One was to be quick and reactive, so it means smaller drops often, but for Year Two we don't need to put fires out or anything, so it's more what good, chunky little piece of meat... we can drop and have people come back and enjoy it.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",
