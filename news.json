At the time, some sources noted that Microsoft put a \"hold\" on production rather than a full cancellation. But now, Contraband's fate appears to be sealed as mass layoffs at Avalanche have resulted in the closure of its Liverpool studio. Avalanche announced the news on its official site, and disclosed that it means 31 developers are losing their jobs. Per United Kingdom labor laws, Avalanche initiated \"a collective consultation process\" in September before moving ahead with the layoffs and closing the studio. However, the rest of the company remains intact. \"The exceptional talent, passion, and commitment from everyone leaving have impacted every project,\" reads the message from Avalanche. \"We are truly grateful for the dedication and invaluable contributions to Avalanche Studios Group.

    "title": "Why Half-Life 3 Rumors Are Intensifying Again",
    "description": "Over two decades have passed since Half-Life 2 was released, but its developer, Valve, has never gotten around to making Half-Life 3. Instead, Valve has been busy turning Steam into the top marketplace for PC game sales (and making a VR spin-off that won our GOTY award). But every once in a while, rumors about Half-Life 3 flare up, and it's happening again right now. As noted by Kotaku, Valve's Steam storefront says that it has two upcoming games, but only Deadlock is listed, and that title is still in early access. The Game Awards are also coming soon, and there almost always seems to be speculation that Half-Life 3 will debut there. Some fans have also read a little too much into The Game Awards' post celebrating today's 27th anniversary of the original Half-Life. 27 years ago today, Valve released HALF-LIFE, it's first game. pic.twitter.com/9d13MAyAmB — The Game Awards (@thegameawards) November 19, 2025 For the record, The Game Awards makes that same post on this date every year. But that's never stopped the speculation before. Dataminers have also been snooping around in Valve projects, and claim to have found evidence of an unannounced shooter codenamed HLX. More recently, Valve unveiled Steam Machine and Steam Frame, and fans have noted that Half-Life 3 would probably help the company sell a lot of hardware. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "From a distance, the new twelve-sided tower rising in Phoenix’s Arts District looks like it belongs in a futuristic cityscape--or maybe in the middle of a very enthusiastic geometry lesson. However, ask the designers and they'll tell you there's a wink and a nod to a certain beloved racing game: Mario Kart. \"To build buildings that are unique that people stop and say, 'Hey, what is that?' I think is important to any downtown,\" said Zac Cohen, creative director at Räkkhaus, the architectural firm behind the project, to Fox 10 in Phoenix. In other words: If you think this building looks quirky now, just wait until you learn what inspired it. The complex takes its name from a famously chaotic, candy-colored racetrack known for sending players plummeting into the void, Rainbow Road. Obviously, you won't see any characters or trademarked symbols on the exterior--a strategic choice, given a certain company's well-known legal enthusiasm--but the references are there if you know where to look and if you look hard enough.

    "description": "The first major Arc Raiders update arrived last week, with the introduction of the Stella Montis map as one of the main highlights. Now, days later, developer Embark Studios has revealed on X some statistics about how players have fared in the abandoned facility. To start, the Shredder enemy is living up to its namesake, knocking out more than 2.2 million players. The Shredder is just one of the new additions with the North Line update for Arc Raiders. The Matriarch is another fresh ARC foe terrorizing players, and it's much larger than the Shredder. However, Embark notes 26,923 Matriachs have been dismantled so far, so players have found success against them. Overall, there have been 25 million visits to Stella Montis. Of those, somehow 117 players discovered a way to down themselves with volcanic rock, which seemingly baffles even Embark. Congrats to every Raider who staked their claim on Stella Montis last week! 🏔️The tunnels that awaited at the end of the Breaking New Ground project were cold and unforgiving, here's how the action played out: pic.twitter.com/NzH9orgtI6 — ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) November 19, 2025 Arc Raiders players had to donate resources to initially unlock access to Stella Montis, which they did faster than anticipated. In fact, Embark highlighted that one particular person offered up over 26,000 resources during the community event. Over the past week, Arc Raiders hit a peak of over 480,000 concurrent players on Steam alone--the extraction shooter is also available on the Epic Games Store as well as PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.

    "title": "Leaked Underwear Homer Would Be First Fortnite Skin With Nipples",
    "description": "Fortnite's Simpsons season is apparently about to become a landmark for Epic Games' metaverse for reasons nobody could have expected--by reportedly offering the first shirtless character sporting visible nipples. The skin in question is an additional version of Homer Simpson, separate from the one in the battle pass, who's wearing nothing but his tighty whities. First look at New (Giant) Homer Skin! pic.twitter.com/LI2ibt7SfM — Dr Cacahuette - FN Leaks (@DrCacahuette) November 19, 2025 The discussion about Fortnite skins lacking nipples goes back to 2019, when a gigantic, shirtless and nipple-less digital version of Travis Scott performed a concert in Battle Royale. Since then we've gotten plenty of other shirtless guys as skins--but none have had nipples. It's not really that hard to figure out why that's been the norm, though, since Fortnite's art style is not realistic or detailed enough for nipples to be anything other than weird. But with Homer, who's cel-shaded and not very detailed, they can draw a couple circles on his chest that don't look upsetting the way that more detailed nipples on, say, the Mr. Savage skin probably would. This mostly-naked version of Homer Simpsons is reportedly going to be an item shop skin.Meanwhile, Homer in his underwear is a topic because this week's update added some loading screens, like the one above, that indicate pretty clearly we'll be facing off against a Giant Homer before the season ends--likely controlled by a player, similar to the Megazord and Godzilla events earlier this year. That this Giant Homer will also be a skin sold in the item shop is just a rumor for the moment, and it's possible that the model that has been datamined is merely the giant one that will roam the Battle Royale island.
