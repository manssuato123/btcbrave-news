    "description": "As The Game Awards 2025 came to a close, we got one more surprise: Wildlight--a team of devs led by folks who previously worked on Titanfall 2 and Apex Legends--announced its new game: Highguard. Not only that, the game will be playable in a few weeks. A gameplay trailer showcased that Highguard leans into Apex Legends' hero shooter formula but takes it in a different direction, opting for an objective-based raid shooter as opposed to a kill-or-be-killed battle royale. The narrative direction of the game is different too, opting for something that looks more high fantasy (like horses, magic, and pet familiars) while still maintaining that science-fiction flair when it comes to the various characters' abilities and firearms. On Steam, Highguard is described as a \"PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent. [Players will battle] rival Warden crews for possession of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure territory in this all-new breed of shooter.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "After breaking The Game Awards' record for the most nominated game of all time, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has shattered yet another record, officially becoming the most award-winning game in the award show's 12-year history. After securing 13 nominations, the debut title from Sandfall Interactive took home nine awards, including Game of the Year. Expedition 33 also received awards for Best Narrative, Best Game Direction, Best Art Direction, Best Score and Music, Best Independent Game, Best Debut Indie Game, Best Performance (Jennifer English), and Best RPG. Prior to Expedition 33, The Last of Us: Part II held the record for the most The Game Awards wins in one night. Naughty Dog's revenge-fueled, action-adventure game took home seven during 2020's The Game Awards, as well as the award for Most Anticipated Game back in 2017. Other big The Game Awards winners include God of War: Ragnarok and Baldur's Gate 3 with five wins each, and Overwatch and Astro Bot, both of which secured four in their respective release years. Of course Expedition 33 wasn't the only winner at 2025's The Game Awards--though it certainly felt close. Other winners include Hades 2, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Donkey Kong: Bananza, Battlefield 6, Doom: The Dark Ages, South of Midnight, and No Man's Sky. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The Arknights spin-off features action-RPG gameplay in a semi-open world, mixed with elements of factory simulation like Satisfactory--and, of course, plenty of anime girls for its gacha system. The release date was dropped at the end of a trailer, which also doubled as a music video, revealing Endfield's title track Give Me Something for the very first time. The track is performed by American band OneRepublic, who also appeared in the trailer alongside Endfield's cast of launch characters. Endfield is a spin-off from tower defense game Arknights, moving away from the franchise's origins with more traditional action-RPG mechanics. Setting it apart from the many other anime-style gacha RPGs that spawned from Genshin Impact's success, Endfield also includes elements of strategic management, with factory-simulation mechanics similar to Factorio or Satisfactory.

    "description": "At The Game Awards, developer S-Game has released a new trailer for its upcoming action game, Phantom Blade Zero, confirming a release date of September 9, 2026 on PC and PlayStation 5. The trailer was pretty epic, starting with some CGI of a martial artist crossing swords with some thugs while carrying a baby in some Death Stranding kind of way. We then cut to some actual gameplay of our protagonist, the elite assassin Soul, as he travels around various environments, enters various cutscenes, and engages in various battles. It's not quite a souls-like, but based on combat encounters and enemy designs, you'd think it was one. Actually, it looks like a cool mix between Where Winds Meet, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty. First announced back in 2023, Phantom Blade Zero is one of several high-profile games inspired by '80s and '90s Chinese Wuxia action movies. Phantom Blade Zero features a seamless map with interconnected regions for players to explore. This aspect of the game was inspired by classic Dark Souls, while combat revolves around fast-paced offense and even quicker blocks against your usual cannon-fodder enemies and tougher bosses.

It is one of many upcoming Star Wars games in the works, but this one is all about speeding past Star Wars environments at several hundred kilometers per hour. Galactic Racer certainly seems to pay homage to Episode 1: Racer, but that game was all about podracers, while Galactic Racer's trailer focused more on more types of vehicles, like speeders and speederbikes. The brief trailer showed lots of new models of vehicles we haven't seen before, but with a distinct Star Wars style. The trailer also made use of the Star Wars sequel trilogy, showing a racetrack on Jakku in the shadow of the AT-AT graveyard, from Episode IX. It left off with a tease for Sebulba, the infamous racer who was rivals Anakin Skywalker in Episode 1. That's so wizard. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Warframe Turns To A Very Unexpected Person To Explain Its Lore: Werner Herzog",
    "description": "Warframe has been hanging around in perpetual beta for well over a decade now. Even the developers joked about it at The Game Awards this year. The game may not be finished, but it still holds a whole world of mythology to dive into. And who better to reintroduce players to Warframe than documentarian and occasional actor, Werner Herzog. Although Herzog didn't appear in person, he left quite an impression in the trailer below. In terms of backstory and mythology, Warframe is a little convoluted. The short version is that players control Tenno, warriors who were asleep in suspended animation for centuries before being awakened in the middle of an intergalactic war. There have been 13 years of story expansions, and it's a little too much to take in all at once. And yet Herzog's delivery goes a long way toward making it sound very compelling. \"The Game Awards is a special night, and it's inspiring to see different industries come together to celebrate the craft of game making,\" Warframe creative director Rebecca Ford said in a statement. \"That's exactly why our partnership with Werner Herzog was so perfect for this trailer. He brought a totally fresh perspective to Warframe, embracing its strange beauty and human core. This collaboration allowed us to see our own world we created through different eyes, and we have never been more sure of Warframe's future for 2026 and beyond. Thank you to everyone who helped us survive for more than 12 years. We look forward to continuing to be weird and doing things our own way to serve our communities across every medium we can.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "A short but sweet new preorder trailer for Housemarque's highly anticipated third-person shooter Saros appeared during The Game Awards on December 11. The trailer didn't tell us much we haven't learned from the previous trailer: there's still an eclipse, actor Rahul Kohli being handsome and angsty, and a whole lot of projectiles and tentacles. What's definitely new, however, is where it ended: on a new release date of April 30, 2026, pushed back from the original date of March 20. At first glance, Saros looks like a pretty straightforward follow-up to Returnal, but it features a number of gameplay differences that pull it further away from roguelite territory. Resources and progression are not lost upon death in Saros, though the world will still be altered, providing a unique experience each run. It stars Kohli, known for Midnight Mass, The Electric State, and more. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

No Law follows Grey Harker, a retired military veteran living in another neon-soaked metropolis called Port Desire. He leaves active service for a life of peace, but one day he is attacked in his home, and he sets out to learn the truth behind the encounter. Harker’s quest can be approached through a direct approach with guns blazing, or with a careful touch via stealth tactics. In an interview with GameSpot prior to the TGA reveal, Neon Giant co-founders Tor Frick and Arcade Berg spoke at length about how player choices are key to No Law--especially in how Port Desire reacts to those choices.

    "description": "Sometimes you get caught on camera at something like a baseball game, and your face is forever immortalized with whatever cheese or grimace you made. Ben Starr understood that as, when the camera cut to him during a The Game Awards segment, the prolific voice actor gave a wry smile and two thumbs up. And honestly, it might just be the perfect meme to encapsulate this whole year. Digital Extremes' community director Megan Everett and creative director Rebecca Ford took to the stage to talk about the free-to-play shooter-RPG Warframe. While discussing how they're not there to announce that the game is out of open beta after 12 years of development, Ford shot directly at Starr because the only thing they learned in 12 years is that he'll \"do anything for money.\" Cue to Starr, cascaded in a red hue as he gives a slight smile and a double thumbs-up in what could easily be a Call of Duty or Fortnite emote.
