We've seen some terrific Lego promotions over the past few weeks, including Star Wars models for 50% off, Batmobiles for all-time low prices, Formula 1 and Fast &amp; Furious race car deals, and rare price cuts on Lego Icons models like the awesome Pac-Man Arcade. There are still some fantastic Lego deals available, but there's no guarantee any of them will be available after today (December 1). We've rounded up the best Cyber Monday Lego deals available now. Cyber Monday Lego Deals: Amazon | Walmart | Target | Lego Store | Best Buy Not every Lego deal is explicitly marked as a Cyber Monday deal. This happens most often when Amazon matches a deal from a competitor. As such, Amazon's store page for Lego deals is missing a lot of great offers, so the lists below look different than Amazon's official Cyber Monday Lego hub.

Likewise, Epic has added a few new types of items that have no real precedent in Fortnite, and some of them are exceptionally powerful. But for this story, the biggest new addition is the boss kits, which drop when you defeat an NPC boss. These kits are locked in your inventory until you win the round or die, make you look like the boss the kit came from, and give you increased health and stamina, and an ability unique to that boss that you have to activate manually by using the item. Oh, and it shows everyone on the map exactly where you are. There are three of these bosses at the moment, and they rotate randomly between five locations: Ripped Tides, Classified Canyon, Painted Palms, and either side of the lake east of Wonkeeland. Without any further ado, let's see what we're working with in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, from the deadly new weapons to the awesome new Self-Revive Kit. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Get Sony 4K Blu-Ray Player For $218 During Amazon's Cyber Monday Sale",
    "description": "Sony UBP-X700U 4K Blu-ray Player (2025 model) $218 (was $300) Get deal at Amazon Get deal at Best Buy If you're interested in adding a dedicated 4K Blu-ray player to your home theater, check out Amazon's deal on the Sony UBP-X700U before it disappears. Released earlier this year with a $300 price tag, the entry-level Sony 4K Blu-ray player is on sale for only $218 for Cyber Monday. The $82 discount matches the deals we saw during Prime Day and Big Deal Days. Sony UBP-X700U 4K Blu-ray Player (2025 model) $218 (was $300) Sony Blu-ray players have a solid reputation, and the X700U model on sale offers a number of features found in some of Sony's high-end line of Blu-ray players. It plays 4K Blu-rays in native 4K UHD (2160p) resolution and supports HDR10, which improves picture brightness. It comes with an HDMI cable, but we'd recommend grabbing a second 4K cable if you don't have a spare. That's because the player has two HDMI out ports. The main one is for video and audio, and is the only one you must use, but the second output is dedicated to audio. Separating audio from video output produces a richer, clearer sound, so dual ports are common on dedicated 4K Blu-ray players. It's one of the benefits of using a media player for Blu-rays instead of a game console like the PS5 or Xbox Series X. You can grab an Amazon Basics 4K HDMI cable for less than $5 right now. The UBP-X700U also has a Coaxial SPDIF, which can be connected to speakers, soundbars, and TVs. In terms of audio support, the UBP-X700U is equipped with high-end audio enhancements, including Dolby Atmos and DTS:X. One of the coolest features of dedicated Blu-ray players like the X700U is picture upscaling. The X700U can read 4K Blu-ray, standard Blu-ray, and DVDs. When enabled, the built-in tech will enhance the resolution of standard Blu-rays and DVDs. While we haven't tested the 2025 edition of the X700U, the upscaling feature on previous iterations was quite impressive. Standard 1080p Blu-rays can look pretty darn close to 4K resolution, and 480p resolution DVDs are substantially better. Honestly, without upscaling tech, DVDs generally look terrible on modern 4K and HD panels. That said, upscaled output varies, and sometimes there are jagged edges or noticeable oddities that won't be appealing to viewers looking for an authentic experience. Get deal at Amazon Get deal at Best Buy Naturally, if you buy a new 4K Blu-ray player, you should probably pick up some shiny new 4K UHD discs, too. Amazon's Cyber Monday sale features a wide assortment of movies on 4K Blu-ray for steep discounts. You should also check out the Criterion Collection holiday sale, which runs until December 7 and includes classics and contemporary hits for 50% off. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "RDS Game Traveler Deluxe System Case for Switch 2 $25 (was $30) See at Amazon PowerA Slim Case for Nintendo Switch 2 $15 (was $20) See at Amazon Multiple notable Nintendo Switch 2 carrying cases are on sale for Cyber Monday, including two officially licensed options that are consistently near the top on Amazon's charts. The RDS Industries Game Traveler Deluxe System Case is discounted to $25 (was $30). This case has enough room for the console, dock, and other accessories and is the No. 1 best seller on Amazon. For a more compact travel option, check out PowerA's Slim Case, which is on sale for only $15 (was $20). Both deals are expected to expire at the end of Cyber Monday (December 1). Naturally, these aren't the only Nintendo Switch 2 carrying cases on sale for Cyber Monday. Multiple of the most popular unlicensed cases have also received discounts. The form-fitting Tomtoc Slim is discounted to $25.89 (was $37), and Belkin's Switch 2 Case is available for $22 (was $30) when you click the coupon on Amazon's store page. Belkin's travel case has a built-in stand for tabletop mode, a mesh pocket for small accessories, a padded insert with 12 game card slots, and a dedicated Apple AirTag holder. RDS Game Traveler Deluxe System Case for Switch 2 $25 (was $30) The Game Traveler Deluxe System Case is a great option for Switch 2 owners who want enough space for the official Dock Set but aren't interested in the large lunchbox-style form factor. From the outside, the System Case looks like a thicker version of the average Switch 2 travel case. RDS designed the System Case with the Switch 2 in mind, but it can be used with the original Switch and Switch OLED thanks to the cushions on each side that double as brackets to hold the smaller consoles in place. Molded ridges protect the Joy-Con 2 triggers and provide an extra layer of protection beyond the ballistic nylon exterior. A padded, fold-out insert with slots for 16 game cards fully protects the screen. The bottom side of the case has two compartments separated by a padded divider. The larger one has room for the Switch 1/2 Dock, a Pro Controller, or Joy-Con Grip. The smaller compartment is for a removable mesh bag with space for the official AC Adapter, an HDMI cable, and other small accessories. Elastic straps hold the accessories in both compartments in place. The System Case also comes with two game card-size plastic cases for microSD Express and a cleaning cloth. The System Case has a padded handle and a rubberized zipper pull with the red Switch 2 logo. If you want enough storage space for the Dock Set and a controller as well as other accessories, the Game Traveler Deluxe System Case is also available in a larger-size version similar to Nintendo's All-In-One Carrying Case. The larger version is $40 and isn't on sale for Cyber Monday. RDS also has two smaller options as well as a couple of bags--check out the full Game Traveler Deluxe lineup for Nintendo Switch 2. See at Amazon PowerA Slim Case for Nintendo Switch 2 $15 (was $20) The PowerA Slim Case is also officially licensed by Nintendo and on sale for Cyber Monday. The Slim Case has an insert with 10 slots for game cards. The insert doubles as a console stand for tabletop mode and protects the screen when traveling. With the exception of cartridges, the Slim Case was designed solely for the console and Joy-Con 2. The form-fitting, molded interior is wrapped in soft fabric. The Slim Case is available in four different colors/themes. The Dark Heather Gray edition shown above is only one that's on sale for $15. A red Super Mario-themed edition with a bunch of Mushroom Kingdom characters on the front is discounted to $16.89. Other options include Metroid Prime 4 and a Pikachu-themed Pokemon edition. See at Amazon Nintendo Switch 2 owners should also check out the Cyber Monday deal on Samsung's officially licensed microSD Express Card. Normally $60, the 256GB Super Mario-themed storage expansion is discounted to only $39 at Amazon and Walmart. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "A new season of Fortnite means a whole new slate of quests to help you grind your way through the battle pass--and you're gonna need it, because progression through the Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 battle pass is much slower than it was last season. With these quests to give you a boost, and with this guide to help you get through those quests as quickly as possible, you'll have that Dark Voyager skin at the end of the pass in no time. Relatively speaking. There's a major complicating factor that will make it a little more difficult to complete some quests right now at the start of the season. The new method of arriving at the island by surfing in from the ocean means you don't really get much choice in where you land. Fortunately, there aren't a ton of quests that require you to visit specific places--but there are a couple of them. There's no need to sweat that too much, though, because the battle bus should be back on December 4, at which point you may be able to quest normally once again. With the disclaimers out of the way, let's take a look at the quests. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The James Bond Collection: 24 Movies (Blu-ray) $55 (was $120) See at Amazon 007: James Bond - Daniel Craig 5-Film Collection (4K Blu-ray) $35 (was $90) See at Amazon 007: James Bond - Sean Connery 6-Film Collection (4K Blu-ray) $80 (was $105) See at Amazon 007: James Bond - Sean Connery Movies (4K Blu-ray) Save over 50% on classic Bond films. See at Amazon James Bond fans can save big on a few awesome 4K Blu-ray and Blu-ray box sets during Amazon's Cyber Monday sale. For the best value, check out The James Bond Collection, a 24-film Blu-ray box set for only $55 (was $120). The James Bond Collection offers incredible value--even if you buy one of the 4K Blu-ray box sets. That's because only the 007 movies starring Daniel Craig and Sean Connery are available on 4K Blu-ray. The Daniel Craig 5-Film 4K Blu-ray Collection is discounted to only $35 (was $90), and the Sean Connery 6-Film 4K Blu-ray Collection is down to $80 (was $105). The Connery 4K box set is substantially more expensive because it launched earlier this year. That said, if you'd like to watch a few classic Bond films from the 1960s without committing to the full collection, Amazon is offering massive discounts on the recently released standalone 4K Blu-rays of each movie. Sean Connery Bond Movies on 4K Blu-ray: Dr. No (1962) -- $17 ($30) From Russia With Love (1963) -- $13 ($30) Goldfinger (1964) -- $13.87 ($30) Thunderball (1965) -- $13 ($30) You Only Live Twice (1967) -- $14.51 ($30) Diamonds Are Forever (1971) -- $13 ($30) Check out the three James Bond box sets below before these deals expire.
