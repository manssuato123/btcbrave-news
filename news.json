    "title": "The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy's Enormous Size Was A Huge Risk - But It Paid Off",
    "description": "55 hours into The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy, Too Kyo Games' visual novel turn-based strategy game, I encountered a particularly touching scene. Two characters, who a few days earlier learned something particularly shocking--one of several moments in the game that recontextualizes the whole experience--get up early and end up watching the sun rise together. It's a little moment of tranquility, of two people bonding over natural beauty amid a particularly rough string of days, and it landed beautifully. It felt like the game was tapping into something a little deeper, a little more melancholic, than what I'd seen before. According to online estimates of the game's total length, at the point I saw this scene, I had another 90-120 hours to go until I could really say that I'd \"finished\" the game, depending on my speed and patience. The name The Hundred Line refers to the number of days the students of Last Defense Academy have to defend their school for as waves of invaders periodically force them into tactical combat. But the name actually has another meaning that you uncover once those 100 days pass for the first time, about 30 hours into the game: This game has 100 unlockable endings, and to get the full picture, you'll want to see all of them. The promise of 100 endings feels like the sort of marketing mistruth that pops up in a press release to play up how much the game is shaped by your choices. A game that claims to have 12 endings might actually mean four endings, each with a few minor potential variations. And yes, some of the endings in The Hundred Line are kind of cheating, or are very similar to each other--not every ending is created equal. But there really are 100 of them, consisting of 21 different \"routes\" that can all end at various different points. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

But sometimes something breaks and you need to reset your character, you have an accessibility need, or maybe you're just 1,000 hours into your game and aren't worried about doing stuff in-engine anymore. That's what console commands are for. Like any big crafting game should, Satisfactory has a variety of console commands available. Continue on for how to use those commands, and what cheats are available. Before we dive in, cheating in Satisfactory isn't as simple and straightforward as we might hope. There are a variety of console commands available, but most of them pertain to user preferences. To use actual cheats, you'll have to install a mod. How to use Console Commands Look at the upper-right corner of your keyboard. You should see a key that has one or more of these characters: ~, `, or §. That last one is pretty standard on a lot of European keyboard layouts. Pressing this will bring up the console. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Satisfactory: How to Use the Awesome Sink and Awesome Shop",
    "description": "The holy grail of Satisfactory is having a perfectly balanced factory, where everything made is used, with your storage emptying at the same rate it's being depleted. But that's not going to happen--you'll have extras. That's what the Awesome Sink is for. What is the Awesome Sink? The Awesome Sink (with Moody Lighting)The Awesome Sink is a building that exists to get rid of all of your extra stuff, rewarding you with tickets based on the complexity of the items. This building is entirely optional, but those tickets can be used in the Awesome Shop to buy things like new cosmetic building parts, walkways, vehicles, and more. There's some really useful stuff in there, so you'd be a fool not to put one up. See the official Satisfactory wiki page on the Awesome Shop for a complete list of available items and ticket values. How does the Awesome Sink Work? You can dump items into the Awesome Sink as quickly as conveyor belts can supply them, so if you have a production line that's pumping out materials at ultra-high volume just for this purpose, the Awesome Sink is ready. You can build multiple Awesome Sinks around your factory, the points they generate are universal to all Sinks, and you can print out your tickets from any Sink at any time. So it's smart to have a Sink in various areas of your megafactory, taking in extra items and turning them for profit. The higher complexity the item, the more points it will generate toward your next ticket. Further, tickets become more expensive with each one generatedFor example, an Iron Ingot generates just two points, while a Crystal Oscillator generates 3,072. A Thermal Propulsion Rocket will generate over 370,000 points. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Everybody needs a friend, and that's especially the case in Satisfactory, where it's just you against all of nature and capitalism. Thankfully, the Lizard Doggo is there to keep you company. And even if you prefer your alone time, there's a good reason to keep a pen of Lizard Doggos around. Lizard Doggos are short, friend-sized lizards with dog-like features. They have a physique similar to that of a Beagle, but are scaled and have armor on their back. Untamed, Lizard Doggos are entirely harmless, and will quickly run when approached if done so carelessly. To tame a Lizard Doggo, you'll need a few Paleberries--the raspberry-like fruit found all over the map. If you already have Blade Runners by this point, unequip them before you try to tame one of these little guys, and toggle your movement speed to slow (Shift key). Find a Doggo and wait until it turns and starts staring at you. At this point, open your inventory and drop a Paleberry on the ground in front of you and wait. The Doggo will slowly approach you to eat the Paleberry. Make sure not to move during this process. Once the Doggo has completely eaten the Paleberry, slowly approach it. You should have a prompt to pet it (E). If you're able to pet it, you're golden--you have a new buddy. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Video game soundtracks often don't stand out unless they're tied to meaningful or memorable points that create a lasting emotional impact, evoking anything from joy or sadness to pure hype or awe. South of Midnight by Compulsion Games manages to intertwine its narrative with its music and audio design in such a way that those unforgettable moments are numerous throughout its 10-12 hour storyline. South of Midnight takes place in a fantasy version of the American Deep South, and it's full of characters and creatures who have lived through tragic events. You play as Hazel--a Weaver who can see ghosts and learn from the past through memories. Hazel helps address and heal others' emotional wounds through a bit of magic and a lot of understanding. As the details behind characters' hardships unfold, their trauma transforms into pieces of music that reinforce the game's themes and live on long after the credits roll. I spoke to lead composer Olivier Derivière and audio director Christopher Fox in two separate interviews to learn more about what went into South of Midnight's tremendous music and audio design.

We also got a peek into another faction of the Mojave Wasteland, one that could potentially spell danger for our protagonists and their questline. The episode opens up with a flashback to Shady Sands in its prime; A welcoming city that almost resembles life before The Great War. We open up on Maximus' parents in their lovely home where his father is testing the radiation levels in the water and discovers most of the water beneath the city is safe to drink and could provide a long term home for Shady Sands’ residents. Life is good until a traveling nomad muttering to himself arrives with an atomic bomb, putting the city in danger. Acting fast amongst the panic and chaos, Maximus' father attempts to disarm it but accidentally activates the bomb’s failsafe, starting the three minute timer to detonation. With little time to spare, he puts Maximus in the kitchen refrigerator and he along with his mother give a tearful goodbye before they’re killed in the blast. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "In early 2025, partway through a subathon to mark her second birthday, the AI VTuber Neuro-Sama became the world record holder for the largest Twitch Hype Train. Many claimed her achievements were possible thanks to Riot's competitive shooter, Valorant, gifting one subscription for each five gifted by the community. Now, only a few days into her third birthday subathon, Neuro-Sama and her creator Vedal987 have smashed that world record. She completed Hype Train level 120 with 118,989 subscriptions and 1,000,073 Bits gifted to the Vedal987 Twitch channel within a limited time. Neuro-Sama is an AI VTuber who recently completed a Minecraft Hardcore run with her creator and friends Filian and Crelly. She streams on Vedal's Twitch channel, and is powered by an artificial intelligence system that utilizes a large language model with vast capabilities. She can \"see\" games and respond to them, even being able to play some, she can read her Twitch chat and interact with viewers, and this week she's been playing around in virtual reality with her friends thanks to her new(ish) 3D model. Neuro-Sama debuted on Twitch on 19 December 2022, and each subsequent year on the same date she begins a subathon--a continuous stream that has its length determined by the number of subscriptions the community has gifted. When an abnormal number of subscriptions or Bits are gifted within a limited timeframe, a Hype Train is triggered, which shows an on-screen percentage, level, and how many subscriptions are required to progress to the next level. While Neuro-Sama met level 111 in January 2025, this time around she didn't need Valorant's help to decimate her own world record. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
