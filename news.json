For the first time since January, Amazon has Disney Lorcana's Into the Inklands Booster Box in stock. It being in stock at all is surprising--though not nearly as surprising as its price. Lorcana fans can snag the Into the Inklands Booster Box for only $83. That's a $61 discount compared to to its original price. We can't imagine Amazon will keep the price this low for long.

    "description": "When news of the revived Steam Machine dropped, throngs of excited enthusiasts quickly staked a claim in its existence. They excitedly heralded its entry into what we all know to be the long-dead \"console war.\" The media chimed in too, opining about the timeliness of its return and whether or not it has the chance to significantly dent the crowded market it's entering into. But I don't think the Steam Machine really needs to \"fight\" in the traditional sense to be competitive. That's because I don't believe it actually has to do anything in order to chip away at the already-crumbling console infrastructure to win hearts and minds. It just has to be there. The console market is arguably in the best place it's ever going to be for a large shakeup. Nintendo is, as always, doing its own thing with the Switch 2, which has proven itself to be a phenomenon beyond what we've seen before, and capable of filling the first Switch's intimidatingly large shoes and serving Nintendo's large niche.

    "description": "All Sony headphones on sale for Black Friday Save big on Sony's best headsets See at Amazon Sony's noise-cancelling wireless headsets have been popular since they were first introduced, and for Black Friday, you can save nearly 40$ on the tthe Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones, which are on sale for $49 (was $400). These offer high-quality audio, strong battery life, and are comfortable to wear all day. You can choose from four colors for this deal: Black, Midnight Blue, Silver, and Smoky Pink, and as an added bonus, you'll also get $30 Amazon credit with the black version. Amazon has similar deals on several other Sony headphone models, including the WH-1000XM6, WH-CH720N, and XM5 Earbuds, all of which are discounted and come with a bonus 60-day Audible subscription. Beyond Amazon's offerings, you can also save a whopping $190 on the Sony WH-1000XM4 wireless headphones at Best Buy, dropping them to just $160 (normally $350). We've outlined all of the best Black Friday deals on Sony wireless headphones below. And for even more savings on tech, video games, and beyond, be sure to check GameSpot's Black Friday Deals Hub. Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless ANC Headphones $248 (was $400) | Includes $30 Amazon credit Sony’s WH-1000XM5 features Auto NC Optimizer technology that adapts noise cancellation to your environment.

See at Amazon Sony WH-1000XM4 $160 (was $350) While Amazon's deal on the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones is great, Best Buy has its own exclusive deal on the previous generation model, the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones. These are very similar to the WH-1000XM5 in form factor, features, and sound quality. While they aren't quite as powerful as the XM5 model, the XM4 headphones still offer excellent playback quality and noise cancellation. Battery life last up to roughly 30 hours, and the support quick-charge via the included charging cable. They also include handy features like touch playback controls, AI audio upscaling, and multipoint Bluetooth pairing so you can connect them to multiple devices simultaneously.

See at Amazon Sony Ult Wear Over-Ear Noise Canceling Bluetooth Headphones $148 (was $250) Amazon's other Black Friday deals for Sony headphones include the Sony Ultra Wear Over-Ear Noise-Canceling Bluetooth Headphones. While they're not quite on par with the tech in the WH-1000X line, they're still a solid choice for mid-range active noise cancellation. Note that this is the only Sony headphone deal at Amazon that does not include a bonus gift card or Audible subscription. See at Amazon Sony WH-CH720N $88 (was $171) | Includes 60 days of Audible If the above headphone models are outside your price range, you might want to check out the budget-friendly WH-CH720N, which are down to $88 (was $171). This is another pair of wireless noice-cancelling headphones, and though they lack some of the premium features of the other models we've covered, they also won't break the bank. You'll also get a complimentary 60-day Audible subscription along with the discounted price if you grab these at Amazon. See at Amazon Sony XM5 Earbuds $228 (was $248) | Includes 60 days of Audible For something more compact, the Sony XM5 Earbuds are on sale for $228 (was $248).

    "description": "World of Warcraft: Midnight, the eleventh expansion in the long-running MMO and the second chapter of the Worldsoul Saga, is set to launch on March 2, 2026. Positioned between The War Within (2024) and the future expansion The Last Titan, Midnight marks a major return to one of Azeroth's most iconic settings while pushing the overarching saga toward its cosmic climax. Revealed during this past summer and showcased heavily at Gamescom, the expansion signals a dramatic escalation in the war between Light and Void. Set in a fully rebuilt and reimagined Quel'Thalas, Midnight centers on a massive Void invasion led by Xal'atath, whose manipulations during The War Within left Azeroth vulnerable to the voidlord Dimensius. The Void now seeks to claim the Sunwell--a source of potent magical energy--and plunge the world into terror. Players will work to reunite the fractured elven tribes, forge alliances with ancient powers, and ultimately join the Light's armies in a desperate effort to repel the Shadow once and for all. Zones such as Eversong, Zul'Aman, Harandar, and the Voidstorm will be heavily featured for the campaign. Midnight introduces several major gameplay features and progression updates, including player housing, a long-requested addition to the game. The expansion also debuts a new Allied Race, the Haranir, an ancient, root-dwelling people from the hidden zone of Harandar whose flora-grown architecture evokes the natural magics of early Azeroth. Players will be able to choose their zone progression order after completing Eversong, offering additional flexibility in how the campaign unfolds. Alongside returning lore heavyweights such as Wrathion, Khadgar, and Alexstrasza, the story pushes deeper into the tumult of the Worldsoul Saga. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The list of complaints that players have with the current state of Destiny 2 is lengthy. Whether it be issues with the game's new activities hub--the Portal--an unfulfilling grind for better loot, the implied irrelevance of old gear, the quality of missions that are available, or progress-stalling bugs, the argument for this being the lowest point in Destiny's history is strong--despite some other periods that put up competition for that title. While it's impossible to know how the playerbase at large will holistically receive the content I experienced at a two-day preview of Destiny 2's upcoming Renegades expansion, what I do know is that there is a lot there for the community to engage with, which already feels like a step up from the previous expansion The Edge of Fate. When Renegades launches in December, the first thing players will encounter is its campaign, which is serving double duty. Its first responsibility is as a continuation of The Fate Saga, the multi-expansion story that kicked off with The Edge of Fate. At the end of that release, we learned of a vague prophecy that foretold the end of everything, lest our player Guardians \"bind the Nine;\" a group of primordial, fourth-dimensional beings who pull the strings of Destiny's universe. But what does binding the Nine actually entail? That's the million-glimmer question at the heart of the saga. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
