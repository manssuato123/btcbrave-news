As in previous years, Amazon is offering big discounts on titles from multiple publishers, and even better, several of these collected editions are B2G1 Free. While you aren't limited to choosing just comic books for this promotion, it's still great to choose three and get the lowest-priced one for free. Many of these limited-time deals kicked off on Black Friday and will continue through Cyber Monday--unless they sell out first. So what's on the shelf? Dozens of Marvel, DC, IDW Publishing, and manga box sets have been discounted for the next few days, and if you're a Batman fan, you're going to be spoiled for choice. Iconic storylines like Knightfall, Under the Red Hood, and Hush are all on sale, while the comic book adaptations of Batman: The Animated Series and Batman Beyond have also gotten big price cuts. If you're looking for a gift idea, we'd recommend Batman: One Bad Day, a collection of eight hardcover graphic novels inside of a collector's edition slipcase.

    "description": "Lego City Robot World Roller Coaster (986 pieces) $70 (was $100) See at Amazon Some of Lego's most popular sets aren't based on licensed IP but rather on original series. Lego City is a prime example, and thanks to this weekend's Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, you can grab the fan-favorite Lego City Robot World Rollercoaster set for just $70 (was $100) on Amazon. This kit combines a fun sci-fi theme with cool set pieces, including a working roller coaster and a giant, posable robot. Lego City Robot World Roller Coaster (986 pieces) $70 (was $100) The roller coaster is the main attraction of this 986-piece kit. The coaster features a few bends and twists, a moving carriage that can seat three minifigures, and a fully articulated mech suit. The finished set also features theme park scenes like a photo desk for guests to take a few snapshots of their experience, a mini arcade for some digital entertainment, and a slushie bar and a DJ booth built right into the rollercoaster. You'll also get eight minifigures of park attendees and employees. See at Amazon Two other Lego City kits to check out include the Yellow Construction Crane for $77 (was $110), and the Lego Yellow Delivery Truck for $70 (was $100). The construction crane kit is a big 1,116-piece build, and the fully assembled vehicle features 16 rubber wheels, support legs that fold out for stability, a hinged operator's cab that can be replaced with counterweights, and four minifigures of construction workers. The hoist on this set can be operated by turning a dial on the crane, while the boom can extend and turn 360 degrees. There's even a portable toilet set that can be built and attached to the hoist hook. The Lego City Yellow Delivery Truck lets you build a scale replica of the big rigs that transport Lego in real life. It comes with four minifigures, and the truck features a sleeper cab, a hinged bonnet, and working rubber wheels. It can be hitched to the trailer, which has side panels that open for easy access. You can even load it up with Lego kits using the buildable forklift, and you can treat the Lego employees to a meal at the hot dog vendor. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Lego Icons Blacktron Renegade (1,151 pieces) $54 (was $100) See at Amazon See at Walmart Lego plans to retire its Lego Icons Blacktron Renegade Set in the near future, meaning those who want to add this unique sci-fi-themed kit to their collection will want to grab one while it's still available. Luckily, the set is available for its lowest price ever of $54 (was $100) at Amazon right now. This discount was first available in the retailer's Black Friday sale, but is carrying over to Cyber Monday--so you have a couple more days to grab it (unless it sells out first). The Blacktron Renegade set is also on sale at Walmart, though it's slightly more expensive at $58.40, but be sure to give it a look if inventory runs out at Amazon. Lego Icons Blacktron Renegade (1,151 pieces) $54 (was $100) The Blacktron Renegade is based on an old Renegade starship design from the Blacktron Future Generation series, which launched back in the '80s. It has over 1,100 pieces, and the completed build measures over 18.5 inches long. Along with the ship itself, you'll also build three additional vehicles--a rover and two speeders--and it comes with three minifigures and a droid. There's also a guide on how to rework the set into the Alienator, which is another popular build from the 1980s. While Lego sets don't immediately disappear when they're retired, they do become much more difficult to find--and if they are available, it'll only be from third-party sellers who mark up the cost. So make sure you grab this kit while you can, as it may be the cheapest it'll ever be. See at Amazon See at Walmart Lego Icons Blacktron RenegadeThis is just one of several Lego sets on sale for Black Friday. Space nerds can also check out a few Star Wars sets up for grabs, including the A New Hope: Tantive IV, which is just $40 (was $80). For something more gaming-related, the massive Lego Icons Pac-Man Arcade Set is $189 (was $270). At over 2,600 pieces, it's a build that'll take quite a while to complete. And if you're already wishing for warmer weather, The Insect Collection is 50% off right now. Along with a chance to build three colorful insects, you'll get to build vibrant green display stands to show off the models. Be sure to also check out Lego's Black Friday Sale, as you'll get a variety of freebies depending on how much you spend.

    "title": "Fortnite Made Quentin Tarantino's Long-Awaited Unfinished Chapter A Reality",
    "description": "Quentin Tarantino's fourth film, Kill Bill, was famously so long that it was split into two separate movies: Kill Bill Volume 1 and its sequel, Volume 2, released about half a year apart back in the early aughts. Soon, it'll celebrate a re-release, Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair, which stitches the movies back together and adds new scenes, too. But even a movie of its length has scenes left on the cutting room floor. Using Epic's Unreal Engine, Tarantino is closing a chapter of his career that's been more than 20 years in the making. Totally separate from the new scenes found within The Whole Bloody Affair, The Lost Chapter: Yuki's Revenge is a roughly 10-minute scene built in Unreal Engine that brings together the Kill Bill series and, unexpectedly--or perhaps not--Fortnite. I recently attended the premiere of Yuki's Revenge at the packed Vista Theater in Los Angeles, alongside Tarantino and \"The Bride\" herself, Uma Thurman, who were on hand to debut this long-lost scene now that it's found its surprising home. The scene, Tarantino explained after the showing, was always considered by him to have happened in the canon of the Kill Bill story. \"The audience just didn't see it,\" he explained, as it wasn't feasible at that time for the cast and crew to film what is essentially another bloody fight scene in a movie already full of them. Its absence was known to film buffs and fans of the director going back years, with many wishing it had made it into the movie originally. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

In the meantime, though, Fortnite's servers are offline for maintenance and to deploy the Chapter 7 update. There's no bug here--Fortnite is offline on purpose. But it shouldn't be down for long. UPDATE: Servers are back online as of 4:30 PM PT. Chapter 7 has begun! When will Fortnite Chapter 7 start? In the past, the start of a new chapter came with longer periods of downtime--like a day or more--but these days Epic tends to treat new season and new chapter updates the same as it would a regular mid-month patch. That means you can expect Fortnite to be offline for between 4 and 7 hours, with Chapter 7 likely launching in the evening on Saturday, November 29, likely around 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET--primetime, in other words.

    "description": "Legends Pinball Micro Machine $310 (was $600) See at Amazon Pinball machines are an enduring icon of gaming, but their main drawback is that they take up a lot of space. Luckily, AtGames has solved this dilemma with its compact Legends Pinball Micro Machine, and you can get one at the all-time low price of $310 during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The MSRP for these machines is $600, and while the price has fluctuated and dropped to around $330 in the past, this is the first time we've seen one of these tables go on sale for this low a price. Be sure to check out Amazon's limited-time offer on the Legends Pinball Micro Machine while this discount lasts. Legends Pinball Micro Machine $310 (was $600) Unlike traditional pinball machines, the Legends Pinball Micro table uses an LCD playing field instead of a mechanical, analog board. It's a scaled-down replica of real-deal pinball machines, and since it has no legs, it can easily fit on a desk or any other flat surface. The 15.6-inch LCD screen displays smooth 60fps gameplay, and there's 16GB of storage for loading new games onto the machine. It comes with pre-installed 50 tables from the Zaccaria library, including classics like Space Invaders, Bubble Bobble, and more. Along with the digital playing table, it also has a dot-matrix screen to display your high score and game graphics, stereo speakers, haptic feedback, and a nudge sensor. The machine features online functionality, including global leaderboards, online lobbies, chat with fellow players, and the ability to download new content. See at Amazon Retro gaming enthusiasts can also check out several more Cyber Monday deals. The Arcade1Up countertop arcade machines are discounted for the first time and are also an affordable, space-saving solution for arcade gaming in your home. The Class of '81 and Pac-Man cabinets are selling for $130 each (normally $150 each) and come preloaded with Namco arcade classics, feature 7-inch vertically oriented displays, and full-size arcade controls. If you have a bit of space to spare, we'd also recommend Arcade1Up's full-size cabinets, as you can save $50 on one. They're also loaded with pre-installed games, each equipped with a sharp LCD display, adjustable speakers, online multiplayer, and original artwork that makes them look authentic to their respective time periods. You can choose from six models on Amazon, such as the Class Of '81 Deluxe Arcade Machine and the NBA Jam Deluxe Cabinet. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Razer USB 4 14-port dock $190 (was $260) See at Amazon Between 4K video files and large video games, moving data around your PC can be time-consuming. Fortunately, this Black Friday and Cyber Monday deal on the Razer USB 4 Dock can cut down on the waiting time, and it's on sale right now for $190 (was $260). This dock features 14 ports of various formats, including high-speed USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, Ethernet, and more, making it a stylish way to connect external displays and peripherals to your PC, laptop, or other devices. Amazon's deal applies to two color options (Black and Mercury), so in case one sells out, be sure to check the other to see if it's in stock. Razer USB 4 14-port dock $190 (was $260) As mentioned above, the Razer USB 4 dock lets you expand and streamline your setup with 14 additional ports. This includes a high-speed USB 4 port, a laptop charging connection, a dedicated 1GB ethernet port, multiple USB-A ports that support USB 3.2 Gen 2, and a dedicated USB-A 2.4GHz port for reduced interference when wireless devices are connected. The other big draw is the dual-monitor support you can access through the dock, which can power a primary 4K 120 Hz monitor while still providing enough power for a second screen. Razer USB 4 14-port dock Black -- $190 ($260) Mercury -- $190 ($260) See at Amazon Spending $190 on a USB dock might sound expensive, but it's worth noting that this hardware commands a premium price. Yes, there are cheaper devices like the Amazon Basics dock at $88, but you're getting a lot less bang for your buck. Razer's USB dock has been widely praised since its launch, and the company also offers a 10-port Thunderbolt 4 dock. This is more expensive at $251 (was $320), but if you need to move large files in a hurry and want several devices connected at the same time, this is a recommended hub. There's even a Thunderbolt 5 11-port docking station, but it's not on sale for Cyber Monday, and it retails for $400. One useful feature of this model is that you can install an SSD, as it has an integrated M.2 slot that supports up to 8TB of storage. If that sounds like the ideal solution for your setup, check out GameSpot's list of the best SSD deals currently available. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
