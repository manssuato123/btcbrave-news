    "title": "Target's Best Exclusive Lego Sets Get Rare Holiday Discounts",
    "description": "Target-Exclusive Lego Set Deals 14 exclusives and dozens more Lego sets are on sale this week. See all deals at Target Target has kicked off a last-minute holiday sale on Lego sets that's arguably better than the promotion it ran during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The discounts aren't as large as last month's sale, but more products are included, and most importantly, a greater quantity of exclusives are up for grabs. Target has more exclusive Lego sets than any other major retailer, including a bunch of models designed for adults. And by \"exclusive,\" we mean you can only buy them at Target or the Lego Store--though typically you'll pay full price directly from Lego. We've rounded up all of the Target-exclusive Lego sets on sale this week, including two Star Wars models, two Spider-Man sets, a very cool Mario Kart racing set, and unique builds themed around major movie franchises like Gremlins, Willy Wonka, and Wicked. Target-Exclusive Lego Set Deals (December 2025) Lego Ideas: Gremlins Gizmo (1,125 pieces) -- $88 ($110) Lego Ideas: Magic of Disney (1,103 pieces) -- $80 ($100) Lego Ideas: Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory (2,025 pieces) -- $176 ($220) Lego Mario Kart: Piranha Plant Power-Up Pursuit (588 pieces) -- $40 ($50) Lego Marvel: Spider-Man Mask (487 pieces) -- $56 ($70) Lego Marvel: Peter Parker's Apartment (394 pieces) -- $44 ($55) Lego Sonic: Shadow the Hedgehog (720 pieces) -- $56 ($70) Lego Star Wars: Wicket the Ewok (1,010 pieces) -- $104 ($130) Lego Star Wars: AT-AT Driver Helmet (730 pieces) -- $56 ($70) Lego Wicked: Glinda &amp; Elphaba Bookends (1,327 pieces) -- $104 ($130) Lego Icons: Holiday Wreath (1,194 pieces) -- $80 ($100) Lego Botanicals: Evergreen Collector's Set (599 pieces) -- $48 ($60) Lego Classic: Cool Creative Box (510 pieces) -- $24 ($30) Lego Super Mario: Peach's Garden Balloon Ride (453 pieces) -- $50 ($60) Target-exclusive Lego sets on sale now (December 2025)Now's the ideal time for deals on the 487-piece Marvel Spider-Man Mask and the 720-piece Shadow the Hedgehog model. Both of these sets are retiring soon, and the Lego Store is already sold out of the Spider-Man Mask. Sonic the Hedgehog fans should also check out Amazon's deals on Sonic sets before they're gone--multiple of the discounted sets retire soon, too. Spidey fans can also save on the 394-piece Peter Parker's Apartment playset. A bunch of Target's deals are on fairly new Lego releases. For instance, fans of adorable furry creatures from film history can get the 1,125-piece replica of Gizmo from Gremlins for $88 (was $110) and the 1,010-piece Wicket the Ewok from Star Wars: Return of the Jedi for $104 (was $130). Gizmo launched October 1, and Wicket released in August. The other Star Wars set on sale is the 730-piece AT-AT Driver Helmet for $56 (was $70). Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Turok Trilogy Bundle $30 (was $40) See at Amazon See at GameStop See at Target See at Walmart A few years ago, Nightdive Studios resurrected the classic Nintendo 64 FPS series, Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, with enhanced remasters on PC and consoles. While all three games in the series were originally released as standalone digital editions between 2018 and 2023, they were recently collected into the physical The Turok Trilogy Bundle, which launched for PS5 and Nintendo Switch on October 31. And now, just a few weeks since launch, the collection is up to $30 off at multiple online retailers. GameStop currently has the best deal, offering the PS5 and Switch editions for just $28 (was $40). Meanwhile, Amazon, Target, and Walmart are all selling the game for $30. Just note that the deal is selling out fast--in fact, the Switch version is already sold out at Walmart, so grab the deal quickly before it's gone. Turok Trilogy Bundle $30 (was $40) The Turok Trilogy Bundle includes Nightdive's remasters of the first three numbered series in the Turok series, including: Turok: Dinosaur Hunter Remastered Turok 2: Seeds of Evil Remastered Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion Remastered Each game in the collection features upscaled graphics with dynamic lighting and enhanced water effects, modern gameplay tweaks, and more. The full data for all three games is included on the disc and the Switch cart. The Switch version is also playable on Switch 2. See at Amazon See at GameStop See at Target Nightdive's Turok Remaster trilogy is also available digitally, but this deal does not apply to the digital releases. The original Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, based on the Valiant Comics series, launched in 1997 for the Nintendo 64 and Windows, becoming an instant classic in the FPS genre. The game was followed by two single-player sequels, Turok 2: Seeds of Evil and Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion--both released on Nintendo 64. The trilogy follows various warriors who take up the mantle of Turok--warriors who protect Earth and a parallel dimension known as the Lost Land from prehistoric monsters, high-tech super soldiers, and inter-dimensional aliens. The series also features the multiplayer deathmatch spin-off for N64, Turok: Rage Wars, and the prequel entry, Turok: Evolution, which launched on GameCube, PS2, Xbox, and PC in 2002.

    "description": "After two and a half years, eleven seasons, and one massive, game-changing expansion, Diablo 4's Age of Hatred is finally coming to a close. Announced as part of 2025's The Game Awards, Diablo 4's next expansion, Lord of Hatred, marks the end of the game's ongoing saga--one which has seen Lilith, Inarius, Mephisto, and the humans of Sanctuary engage in an epic struggle to gain control of the world and its future. But while the upcoming expansion promises a \"satisfying\" conclusion and an \"epic, final showdown\" with the game's big bad, Mephisto, it also promises a number of other exciting features, too. Prior to the expansion's announcement, GameSpot, IGN, and PC Gamer were invited to attend an exclusive interview with two key members of Lord of Hatred's narrative team: lead narrative designer Matt Burns and narrative designer Eleni Rivera. The pair were eager to answer our questions about Lord of Hatred, even those that were, admittedly, both thirsty and bizarre. We left the Q&amp;A session with a better understanding of Mephisto's plans, the lore behind the revamped Paladin class, and the Skovos Isles, as well as a great deal of anticipation--anticipation for more personality-filled dialogue options, plenty of \"Jedi mind tricks,\" and the return of Amazons, Lilith, and Ralph Ineson's velvety voice. IGN: Vessel of Hatred felt like you guys were holding your breath. Was that a Band-Aid or a part of the story that you always wanted to tell? I'm sure you guys heard a little bit of the feedback that Vessel of Hatred was good and also felt like it was teasing out of the showdown that we were all really waiting for. I'm wondering how much of that was planned versus you guys just taking longer to produce this big showdown. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Sega Channel launched in 1994 and was one of the first subscription-based, digital game services, beaming new games and content directly to players' consoles through a television cable. The service shut down in 1998, and since then many of the exclusive games and content available on the service were thought to be gone forever. That is, until the Video Game History Foundation embarked on a quest to see the channel's unique history, and its content, preserved. Alongside former Sega Channel VP of programming Michael Shorrock and a passionate Sega fan who had acquired a collection of Sega Channel backup tapes, VGHF sought to tell the full story of the Sega Channel.
