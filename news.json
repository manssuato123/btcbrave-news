    "description": "Maybe as a holiday treat, Nintendo has added a new GameCube title for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers out of the blue. Wario World is now playable for the service on Switch 2. Originally released in 2003, Wario World is a 3D platformer that sees the antihero looking for payback after his treasure is stolen and his castle destroyed. Coincidentally, Treasure is the developer behind the GameCube title. The studio is known for Gunstar Heroes, Sin and Punishment, and Ikaruga. Wario World brings the GameCube library up to seven titles on Switch 2 for the Expansion Pack tier. What's intriguing about Wario World is that Nintendo has teased GameCube titles that still aren't out on the service, such as Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance and Pokemon Colosseum. Meanwhile, Wario World hadn't previously been mentioned. Luigi's Mansion arrived on the subscription service right before Halloween and was the last addition. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Xbox Wireless Controller – Fallout Pip-Boy $83 (was $99) See at Microsoft Store The second season of Prime Video's Fallout TV series is almost here, and to celebrate, Microsoft has revealed a new Xbox controller that looks like it came straight out of the radioactive wasteland. Currently a timed exclusive through the Microsoft Store, the Fallout Pip-Boy Xbox controller is now available to order for $83 (was $99). If you want to add some flair, you can also customize the controller through the Xbox Design Labs, which lets you choose button styles, upgrade to metallic triggers and D-pads, rubberize the side and back grips, and add an engraving. Xbox Wireless Controller – Fallout Pip-Boy $83 (was $99) Inspired by Vault-Tec's wearable computer, this controller features a black top case, the outer casing of a Pip-Boy, and a bright green Vault Boy icon in the center. The D-pad sports a healthy radioactive glow, and several other design elements replicate the Valued-Added Targeting System from Fallout. Beyond that, this is a standard Xbox wireless controller. It's still the same design that was introduced five years ago, with textured triggers, tactile face buttons, and a very clicky D-pad. These controllers can be powered by AA batteries or a rechargeable battery pack sold separately; they're equipped with an audio jack for wired headphones, and their ergonomic design still makes them very comfortable to use for long stretches. The other great thing about the Xbox controller is that it can be used on multiple platforms, including PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and mobile devices via Bluetooth. See at Microsoft Store Xbox gamers looking for a premium option can grab the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller with a Fallout finish. Priced at $164.58 (was $185), this premium edition of the controller offers adjustable-tension thumbsticks, shorter hair-trigger locks, rubberized grips, and interchangeable components. For more Fallout merchandise, don't miss out on this brand-new bundle that celebrates Fallout: New Vegas' 15th Anniversary. Priced at $155, this is a physical re-release of the beloved open-world RPG and it comes with collectible memorabilia. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Regardless, Microsoft has announced that the Call of Duty franchise led the charge on Xbox Game Pass in 2025 in two key categories. On social media, the official account for Xbox Game Pass noted that Call of Duty ranked first for total players and hours in 2025. Specific figures beyond that weren't included in the announcement. In addition to #1 in November, @CallofDuty closed out 2025 as the #1 franchise on Xbox Game Pass for total players and hours all year 🫡Here’s to @CallofDuty &amp; its worldwide community. Season 1 of #BlackOps7 + Call of Duty: Warzone is just getting warmed up. — Xbox Game Pass (@XboxGamePass) December 10, 2025 The timing is interesting because Activision released a statement of its own earlier this week which acknowledged that Black Ops 7 fell short of the mark the publisher set for itself. Furthermore, Activision pledged to refrain from any future CoD year-to-year releases that are direct sequels, as Black Ops 6 and 7 were. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "In 2012, programmer Chris Oberth passed away after a career that spanned from the dawn of video games in the late '70s to the PlayStation 2 era. Now, one of Oberth's unfinished games, Xcavator 2025, has been completed and it's slated for a physical release on the console it was originally intended for: the NES. The Video Game History Foundation--with the permission and support of Oberth's family--found the source code for Xcavator 2025 in Oberth's development archives. It was originally developed by Incredible Technologies Inc., the company behind the Golden Tee Golf and Big Buck Hunter arcade games. However, it was rejected by publishers in 1991, and it was never seen again until now. To finish the game, the VGHF teamed up with Mega Cat Studios, which was guided by the remaining materials to recapture the spirit of Oberth's original vision. Towards that end, Mega Cat Studios' development team only used the tools and environments that would have been available at the time. A standalone trailer for Xcavator 2025 isn't available yet, but the first footage was screened during the Day of the Devs: The Game Awards Edition at the 1 hour 43:31 mark below.
