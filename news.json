    "description": "Baldur's Gate 3 has been out for over two years now, but fans' enthusiasm for the sprawling RPG remains strong--as is the case with one fan who has spent untold hours documenting and quantifying all the spoken dialogue in the game. Redditor Everwhite-moonlight has taken the time to catalogue the game's extensive spoken dialogue fans, calling the labor-intensive task a celebration of Larian's work. The finished spreadsheet arranges the characters in order from most to least speaking time, which reveals just how much our vampire friend Astarion loves to talk. It's unsurprising that Amelia Tyler's Narrator, whose voice is ever-present through Baldur's Gate 3 as the game's pseudo-DM, has the most lines of dialogue, clocking in at a total of 14 hours and 43 minutes of speaking time. What is surprising is how (relatively) close behind her Astarion sits, with a whopping 13 hours and 6 minutes of dialogue for the Neil Newbon-voiced vampire companion. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "It's been a busy week for industry speculation after Geoff Keighley started posting about a mysterious, glowing monolith in the middle of the California desert, which was later moved into Los Angeles. Now, it appears the monolith's mystery might have just been solved through a trademark filing. Rumors that the monolith was erected to tease new Diablo 4 content, Elder Scrolls 6, God of War, or Lords of the Fallen 2 were all shot down by people in the know. While others speculated that it still could be related to The Elder Scrolls Online, or a new FromSoft game, it appears most likely that the statue is promoting a new Divinity title from Larian. A trio of trademark filings were spotted up by MP1st, including a new Divinity logo and a symbol that looks suspiciously like the glowing one on Geoff Keighley's monolith. The familiar-looking trademarks come after Larian's publishing director said there aren't currently any plans for a Divinity: Original Sin 3, meaning the upcoming title may be a new Divinity game outside of the Original Sin prequel series.

    "title": "Minecraft's Mounts of Mayhem Update Lets Players Ride Into Combat",
    "description": "The fourth and final Minecraft update of 2025 has arrived. Mounts of Mayhem is out now for owners of Minecraft Java and Bedrock Edition. The new Minecraft update allows players to ride into battle on top of their favorite mounts while adding a few new options as well. But as seen in the launch trailer below, the new mounts come with new enemies, and players will have to dispatch those rivals before they can claim ride of their own. Camel husks spawn in deserts and come with two mob riders known as the Parched, both of whom are immune to sunlight. Both riders will have to be defeated before players can claim the camel husks as their own. At night, players may encounter zombie horses, which come with zombie riders. These horses may be undead, but they can still be yours if you defeat their riders. When players go underwater, there are two options: The nautilus and the zombie nautilus. A regular nautilus won't have a rider, and players can win its heart with a pufferfish as a treat. Zombie nautilus, however, are a bit harder to tame because their zombie riders will have to be beaten first. But like their living counterparts, the zombie nautilus love pufferfish.

The game will feature characters from across Cyberpunk 2077 and the anime series Edgerunners, while also drawing from the extended Cyberpunk universe to make a TCG that's faithful to the franchise's origins. IGN reported revealed the upcoming project in an interview with key players from both CD Projekt Red and WeirdCo, who share a mutual passion for bringing Cyberpunk to the TCG space--which will also mark CD Projekt Red's first physical TCG. \"Every one of us at WeirdCo loves the Cyberpunk universe, and we built the TCG bit by bit on this foundation,\" WeirdCo co-founder Elliot Cook said, revealing that the team looked not only to 2077 and Edgerunners for inspiration, but also the Dark Horse comic series. \"At each step we analyzed every little detail, constantly asking ourselves: 'How do we make this more authentic to Cyberpunk?'\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

We expected the 40% discount on this Lego Super Mario display model to disappear on Monday, but it's actually available at more retailers than before. Best Buy featured the Piranha Plant in its weekend doorbuster sale, and Amazon quickly matched the deal. But while Best Buy indeed raised the price back to $60 when the sale ended, Amazon's deal remained available and has since been joined by matching deals at Walmart and Target. It's unclear when the discount will expire at these retailers; Target mentions December 10 on its store page, but end dates at Target aren't always reliable. You can get free shipping at all three retailers, and the Piranha Plant will arrive with plenty of time to spare before Christmas. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
