    "title": "This Game With Rocket Trucks, Yakuza, And Sentient Mascots Is 2025's Most Radically Kind And Empathetic Game",
    "description": "Throughout the events of Promise Mascot Agency, I was Pinky's ride. Anywhere that she needed to go, I had to ferry her in my crappy little truck. As a matter of fact, I was responsible for the transport of any and every mascot that stumbled through the doors of the Promise Mascot Agency and came under my employ. When Kofun needed to go to a nearby graveyard, I was the guy for the job. When Trororo needed a lift to the local adult store, I begrudgingly told him to hop in. Be it by land, air, or sea, it became my responsibility, and mine alone, to make sure everyone got where they needed to go. Promise Mascot Agency is a game filled to the brim with chores and mundane tasks like this. As I traveled across the isle of Kaso-Machi, drifting in and out of decrepit villages and farm fields, I found that Promise Mascot Agency's cast was filled with folks in need of some assistance. The English teacher who worked unpaid overtime shifts to put on a night school at her underfunded workplace. The nearby mechanic with an insatiable curiosity for the occult, and no time between his job and family. If a shrine needed to be swept, I was there with a broom in a split second. Whether it was the local barkeep in a gimp suit, the streamer-turned-farmer, or of course, the disenfranchised youth, I was there with an olive branch to extend. Promise Mascot Agency probably sounds like a convoluted game. It is. In one breath, it is a title about an ex-yakuza--handsomely voiced by the same actor behind Kiryu in the Yakuza games--driving around a countryside, rounding up seemingly endless collectibles and upgrades, and sending living mascots (like a giant crying tofu block) out on jobs via a simplistic management system and card-based minigame. In the latter, you must play support cards with differing strengths and weaknesses as a mascot performs a job in order to beat a troubling interference that arises and assure the job is a success. In another breath, it is a full-throated exercise in the lengths of compassion and empathy. It is rarely sleek and sexy about it--Promise Mascot Agency doesn't feature over-the-top set pieces or hide slick new super moves to reward the player for completing its long list of chores. But real, tender empathy for your fellow man rarely does look so good, and Promise Mascot Agency's unglamorous honesty is something I've come to admire from one of 2025's best and brightest games.

You could think of a mother shouldering burdens alone while her husband is at work. The father in the waiting room while the mother screams with strangers. A woman going to the doctor about an ache, only for him to tell her to lose weight and deny the problem is even happening. All these things are simple clichés--tropes stolen from life and television. When Silent Hill f conjures a woman's private pain, it is with cutting specificity. In one of the most grisly moments of body horror in video games this year (or ever, really), protagonist Hinako turns into an emblem of her own sorrow, her own compliance, her own screaming rage.

    "description": "In the cavernous convention halls of Gamescom 2025, conference attendees gawk at towering installations of fabricated castle sets and pirate ships. The massive movie set-esque booths inspire awe, but off center and to the side of these constructions rests another installation--one that has managed to draw an equally impressive crowd without a flashy monument. Wrapped around this booth are chattering fans--many who appear to be women and femmes in their 20s and 30s--all queued in a line long enough to wrap around a city block. They'll remain this way for the better part of an hour, a singular goal making this endeavor worth the wait: taking a photo with a cutout of their favorite man from Love and Deepspace. Developed by Papergames, a China-based studio known for its work on the Nikki franchise, Love and Deepspace is a narrative-focused mobile game in which players romance and bond with a cast of five men. Since its release in January of 2024--and in the past year especially--Love and Deepspace has inspired a fervor comparable to those around the most beloved boy bands. It won Best Mobile Game Award at Gamescom 2025 and surpassed $750 million in gross player spending within two years of release. Yet Love and Deepspace is more than any individual statistic or accolade. It is an absolute phenomenon--one that has also inspired a fandom characterized not just by its sheer size, but by the dedication of its fans. If you have been curious about the game,or rather what makes it so special, here is everything you need to know about the viral sensation, Love and Deepspace. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Epic has spent the past few years trying as hard as it can to will the Fortnite metaverse into being--and now, at the end of 2025, it's actually starting to look like it's getting there. Things are still very messy, but Epic's moves in that direction--which frequently seem to involve trying random things just to see what happens--may have finally borne fruit. Back at the end of 2023, Fortnite attempted to usher in its metaverse in earnest by launching Fortnite Festival, Rocket Racing, and Lego Fortnite all at once. It didn't quite work, because all three were half-baked and missing key features. The only way to play Racing was in Ranked, Festival lacked instrument support and still doesn't have a practice mode, and Lego Fortnite had the feel of a generic early-access survival game wearing Lego clothing. Two years later, we've got a much prettier picture, but not because Epic went all in on those modes. Instead, Epic has simply kept churning out new modes, some of which have done consistently. Likewise, Fortnite Creative has produced its first blockbuster map with any staying power. Thanks to some key legal victories, Fortnite is once again available on mobile devices in most places, which has dramatically increased the game's potential footprint. And the new cosmetic types added in the past year have proven a lot more popular than the cars and musical instruments that were introduced in Chapter 5. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Drop into the lagoon in Donkey Kong Bananza. Sure, you need to chase Void Kong to the Earth's center to save the day, but maybe you just want to soak in some water-adjacent locales as you explore this new world beneath the surface. There are plenty of secrets tucked away in each level's hidden crevices. When you first hop in there is really only one thing to do: pick a direction and start smashing. Donkey Kong Bananza takes Nintendo's hallmark sandbox exploration and pushes it somewhere the studio rarely goes--pure chaos. Bananza is not interested in the kind of precision platforming that defines Mario's visits to Peach's Castle, Delfino Plaza, or outer space. It captures that same cheerful vibe, but lets players rip through it. There is a long-running design idea at Nintendo that movement should feel good on its own. Shigeru Miyamoto once said he wanted players to enjoy moving Mario around an empty room. The reason Mario is so fun to control in Super Mario 64 is that Miyamoto and the small team behind the N64 classic spent months making sure he felt great to play, even if the only action possible was running around an empty space.

    "description": "SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Wireless Headset (Gen 2) $180 (was $200) See at Amazon If you're looking for a headset for your new gaming console, handheld, or PC, one of the best options for all devices is on sale at Amazon. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Gen 2 is discounted to $180 (was $200) for a limited time. Released in October, the Nova 7 Gen 2 is updated version of one of the best wireless gaming headsets you can buy today. You can choose between the Nova 7P (PlayStation), Nova 7X (Xbox), or Nova 7 (PC) in black, white, or magenta. The 7X offers wireless support for all platforms, while the 7P and 7 work on all devices except Xbox consoles. If you game on Switch 1/2, mobile, Steam Deck, or another device with USB-C or Bluetooth audio support, any of the three versions will work great. For a more premium wireless headset, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro is on sale for $300 (was $380). SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Wireless Headset (Gen 2) $180 (was $200) When considering price, audio performance, and comfort, the Arctis Nova 7 was hard to beat when it launched back in 2022. That remains true over three years later with the Gen 2 model, which offers 40% better battery life--over 50 hours compared to 38 hours--and adds support for the Arctis Companion App. The free iOS and Android app lets you adjust audio settings and switch between over 200 custom sound profiles designed for specific games. Along with these 2.4GHz Wireless profiles, there are a handful of Bluetooth profiles, including Bass Boost and Focus, that come in handy when using the Nova 7 to listen to music. The original Nova 7 worked with the SteelSeries GG desktop app for PC and Mac, but the mobile app is easier to use and allows you to adjust audio settings on the go. The Arctis Companion App was introduced in 2024 alongside the entry-level Nova 5 Wireless Headset, and it only works with select SteelSeries audio gear. If you own the first-generation Nova 7, upgrading probably might make sense if you take your headset with you during your daily commute or use it frequently for handheld gaming. But if Arctis Companion App integration isn't of interest to you, you'll want to stick with the original. But for everyone else, the Nova 7 Gen 2 is a terrific all-around gaming headset that remains my favorite in the $200 and under category. SteelSeries designs the most comfortable gaming headsets on the market, and the Nova 7 is no exception. The adjustable elastic headband and lightweight, memory foam ear cushions are superb, and the sturdy steel frame holds up well. The custom 40mm neodymium audio drivers offer rich, high-fidelity sound; the audio is even more impressive and dynamic when using the custom presets created by SteelSeries. It has a retractable boom mic with AI noise reduction to block out ambient noise like keyboard and controller clicks. Along with 2.4GHz Wireless with the included USB-C dongle, the Nova 7 supports Bluetooth and wired via a detachable 3.5mm audio cord. It also has simultaneous 2.4GHz and Bluetooth audio streams, so you can stay connected and hear sound from two devices at once. See at Amazon Nova 7 vs. 7P vs. 7X SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 (Gen 2)As mentioned, there are three versions of the Nova 7 Gen 2. In the past, SteelSeries has included green or blue accents on the headset to differentiate between the Xbox and PlayStation editions, but the Gen 2 looks the same across the board. The only tangible difference between the three is the dial on the right earcup. The Nova 7X and 7 have a game chatmix dial, but since the PS5 doesn't have this feature, the Nova 7P has a Sidetone dial for mic monitoring. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Arcade1Up NBA Jam Deluxe Cabinet $350 (was $500) See at Amazon See at Best Buy See at Kohl's See at Macy's See at Walmart Nostalgic NBA Jam fans can save big on Arcade1Up's home arcade machine featuring the classic 2v2 basketball game. Earlier this month, the NBA Jam Deluxe Arcade Cabinet was on sale for an all-time low price of $400 (was $500). The price dropped an additional $50 in the days leading up to Christmas. As of December 28, NBA Jam Deluxe is up for grabs for onl $350 at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Kohl's, and Macy's. If you purchase NBA Jam Deluxe from Kohl's for $350, you'll also get $70 Kohl's Cash to use online or at your local store from December 29 to January 4. The NBA Jam Deluxe Cabinet isn't the only Arcade1Up machine on sale for a great price at Amazon and Best Buy. We've included a list of the best Arcade1Up deals at the bottom of this story. Arcade1Up NBA Jam Deluxe Cabinet $350 (was $500) The NBA Jam Deluxe Cabinet is preloaded with three classic arcade basketball games developed by Midway from 1993-1996: NBA Jam, NBA Jam Tournament Edition, and NBA Hangtime. The control deck has two sets of inputs: one arcade stick and three buttons for each player. In addition to local multiplayer, you can play against users around the world over Wi-Fi. Like other Deluxe editions from Arcade1Up, it has a 17-inch HD display, light-up marquee, dual stereo speakers, and a faux coin door on the front. The cabinet is roughly 61.5 inches tall, just under 19 inches wide, and weighs approximately 62 pounds. If you want to sit while playing, Amazon has a limited-time deal on this popular adjustable bar stool with a backrest. Arcade1Up has manufactured several NBA Jam cabinets over the past five years, but the Deluxe Edition is the only model in stores today. Outside of Arcade1Up cabinets, NBA Jam has been dormant for nearly 15 years; the last home console entry, NBA Jam: On Fire Edition, released on PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2011. Thankfully, Arcade1Up's NBA Jam cabinet offers an authentic way to revisit the best entries in the series. See at Amazon See at Best Buy See at Kohl's NBA Jam debuted exclusively in arcades in 1993 and was ported to consoles the following year. The Tournament Edition, which launched in 1994, is essentially an updated and expanded version of the original NBA Jam. As the name suggests, the main addition was Tournament mode. It's still 2v2 basketball, but Midway added a third player to each team, allowing you to make substitutions throughout each game. The Tournament Edition also expanded player stat categories.

    "title": "Games Want You To Play Forever, But Dispatch Tells You When To Stop",
    "description": "Is there a more infamous monkey-paw wish than the collective dream that all our favorite games could last forever? Well, the finger curled, because it seems like all major game publishers in the world only want to make games that go on to infinity. With the rise of live-service games, it's been a struggle to know when to put the controller down, especially when games like Fortnite release seasonal content like The Simpsons season pass that ask you to play long enough to unlock stupid sexy Flanders. Luckily, for us, episodic games, perfectly portioned into bite-sized morsels, have come back to rescue us from the endless grind. In this case, I am talking specifically about Dispatch, the new episodic superhero game from AdHoc Studio. If the name is unfamiliar to you, AdHoc is a new game company founded by former members of Ubisoft, Night School, and perhaps most notably, Telltale Games, who blew up the episodic gaming scene with 2012's The Walking Dead. The studio would later close due to a variety of factors internal and external, some of which I covered previously as a reporter. But by then, the episodic-games formula was starting to feel a bit played out, and the mood appeared to be shifting towards either more complete single-player experiences, or the early live-service games we know today.

    "title": "In The Switch 2's First Year, Every Third-Party Port Tells A Story About The System",
    "description": "In November 2017, Bethesda Softworks and port specialists Panic Button performed what seemed like a miracle: They released a Switch port for id Software's recent reboot of Doom. The game, a famously fast-paced, intense shooter with modern graphics, seemed ill-suited to Nintendo's handheld and its capabilities, but despite some visual blurriness and a reduction in the frame rate, the game held up well on the hybrid system. In GameSpot's 8/10 review of the Switch port, Peter Brown praised the game as \"an impressive port that begs you to consider gameplay over graphics.\" Doom was the first Switch \"impossible port,\" a colloquial term that players took to using whenever a third-party game designed for much more powerful hardware arrived on the Switch in pretty good shape. Over the course of the system's lifespan, it would receive many more so-called impossible ports, including versions of Wolfenstein 2: The New Collossus, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, The Witcher 3, No Man's Sky, and Ace Combat 7--large, visually-intensive, action-heavy games, all of them translated to the system with immaculate care. Seeing how the Switch handled these games was always exciting--even when the ports were less-than-ideal, there was still something special about seeing them run on a handheld from 2017. Prior to the Switch 2's launch this year, Nintendo, in typical fashion, did not tell us much about what the Switch 2 was capable of on a technical level. We knew that the new 7.9-inch 1080p screen was capable of displaying gameplay at up to 120fps and was HDR-compliant. Nvidia announced that the system's custom chip would allow for DLSS, which is capable of upscaling games regardless of native resolution, and that the new system would be, of course, much more powerful than the old one. For early adopters, though, the system's first six-plus months of availability has involved a lot of curiosity over what the system can and can't do, speculating on what games the system could or couldn't handle, and pondering just how close these ports can come to other console versions.
