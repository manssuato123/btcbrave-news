The memorial venue was filled with heartfelt tributes, including copies of his games, artwork, swords, and pieces of his iconic clothing. Photos shared by attendees showed just how much he meant to the gaming community. Itagaki was a major figure in Japanese game development. He founded Team Ninja in the late 1990s and helped shape modern action and fighting games. At the memorial, Koei Tecmo executive Yosuke Hayashi shared memories of meeting him in 2001. Hayashi recalled being assigned to Itagaki's team and being told there was no work for him. 早矢仕洋介氏弔辞（コーエーテクモゲームス代表取締役社長執行役員CEO・コーエーテクモホールディングス取締役副社長）『板垣伴信をヴァルハラに送る会』にて#itagaki https://t.co/HPmFpDXixg pic.twitter.com/az4Y2lTve0 — 勝田 晴美 (@katsuta_harumi) November 28, 2025 \"I was assigned to your department as a game planner.

    "description": "In the 21 years since World of Warcraft launched, one feature has been asked about and requested above all others: player housing. Despite being the premier MMORPG for over two decades, housing in WoW has always felt like a pipedream. Now, that dream is finally a reality, as an early-access version of player housing is launching December 2 for those who preorder WoW's eleventh expansion, Midnight. It's been a long time coming. Housing as a feature was experimented with in WoW's earliest days but never came to fruition. In 2014, WoW's Warlords of Draenor expansion gave players a taste of what a full-fledged player housing system could be in the form of Garrisons. These large, base-like personal towns met nearly all of a player's needs in one location. But Garrisons quickly became more of a lesson in what Blizzard shouldn't do when it came to player housing. Barely customizable, Garrisons were also extremely isolating. With access to so many amenities in one, private location, players didn't need to be out in the world or hanging out in one of WoW's capital cities. Garrisons whetted players appetites for housing, but whenever Blizzard was asked about when a proper housing system might arrive, it always replied that it wanted to do the feature justice and was waiting for the right moment to make it happen.

    "description": "Arc Raiders players recently discovered an exploit that allowed them to loot locked rooms without needing a keycard. Naturally, the exploit quickly became popular--and frustrating for players who didn't use it--leading Embark Studios to apply a \"hot\" fix to this part of the game. If you now decide to cheese your way into one of these treasure rooms, you can now expect a toasty reception inside. Using a keycard to access one of these rooms ties into the high-risk, high-reward nature of Arc Raiders, but the exploit essentially bypasses it. Players managed to break into the room, grab valuable gear without worrying about being ambushed, and pick the location clean. This meant that players who unlocked the room properly would find it stripped bare, leading to frustration within the Arc Raiders community. To remedy this, Embark Studios made it so that the rooms automatically activate flamethrowers when you glitch into them. Players quickly found out that they would be caught inside this deathtrap, while other players with keycards would discover a room full of loot and a freshly cremated adventurer.
