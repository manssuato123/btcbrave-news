    "description": "Five years after the first live-action Sonic the Hedgehog movie was released, fans have almost forgotten how close they came to seeing pure nightmare fuel in that blockbuster movie. The original Sonic design was a strange mix of blue fur and too many teeth, but the redesign of Sonic that followed was far more faithful to the video games. A26, a group of renegade Sonic fans, isn't satisfied with it. They're busy putting Ugly Sonic back into the movie, with a project called Sonic the Hedgehog: The 2019 Cut, and a trailer for it is set to be released on December 24. A26 originally intended to have the trailer out this week, but they weren't satisfied with the result and pushed the date back a few weeks. \"We wanted Sonic’s animation to feel as fluid as possible, and to be honest, it would have gotten some negative reviews if we’d released it today,\" A26 wrote in a social media post. \"We promise it will be totally worth it, paying tribute to the original design as it always should have been.\" A short clip for you all 🫣Hope you like It#GottaFixFast🌀🦔 pic.twitter.com/2ET7vPsZSV — Sonic The Hedgehog: The 2019 Cut (@SonicCut2026) December 11, 2025 To give you an idea of what you can expect, A26 releases a short GIF of Ugly Sonic jogging inside a washing machine. The project is expected to be released online in 2026. While it's going to be a long wait to see the 2019 cut of Sonic the Hedgehog, you can see the infamous character--voiced by I Think You Should Leave's Tim Robinson--save the day in 2022's Chip 'n Dale movie.

    "description": "The recent A Safehouse in the Hills update for GTA Online may contain clues about Grand Theft Auto VI, or at least that's what the franchise's passionate fanbase is theorizing based on some recent discoveries. After the big new update went live on December 10, people dug into the game's code in search of anything that might provide clues about GTA 6, and people think they found some. A line of text that was discovered references a voice line for the character Jimmy, the son of main character Michael, that says he is \"moving out of state.\" Another line, from his mother Amanda, says, \"Our son is finally moving away from home.\" People are taking this to suggest that Jimmy may have moved to Leonida, the stand-in for GTA 6's setting of Florida, but that's just conjecture for now. Dataminers also discovered that the KnoWay autonomous driving company that was added to GTA Online in the new update was formerly known as Sahara. That is the name of a delivery and logistics company for GTA 6, as seen in previously released GTA 6 screenshots. The dataminer, Tex2, theorized that Rockstar might have at one point planned a Part 2 for the A Safehouse in the Hills expansion to be timed with GTA 6's previous release date of May 2026 prior to the game's delay to November 2026.

    "description": "Bigfoot isn't a myth. It's real, and it's really wandering around the forests ... in Fortnite, as a new update added the mythical sasquatch to the battle royale shooter. Thanks to a recent 39.10 update that landed on December 11, players noticed something strange in Fortnite's woods. Apparently, Epic Games introduced Bigfoot to the game's sprawling world, but it isn't easy to find. Bigfoot roams the entire map, meaning it could appear by the Fore Fields, near the Humble Hills, and anywhere in between. It's also immune to damage, so shooting it means nothing. And if you get within 35 meters, it vanishes, leaving you on yet another wild sasquatch hunt before getting blasted to death. BIGFOOT WAS ADDED IN TODAY'S UPDATE 😭He walks around the entire map, is immune to damage, and will disappear if you get too close to him(via @FN_Assist) pic.twitter.com/Mdi5GxeSoU — Shiina (@ShiinaBR) December 11, 2025 Contrary to its name, however, Bigfoot isn't that big. As players found it, it actually appears rather little. The perspective could be off, but based on screenshots circulating on X, Bigfoot looks no bigger than a budding flower. Maybe it should be known as \"Littlefoot,\" then. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "A new report detailed how much it costs for developers to have their games shown off at The Game Awards. Kotaku reported that a 60-second trailer can cost up to $450,000, with the price scaling to $1 million for a three-minute trailer. The ad sales team for The Game Awards can charge that much due in part to the show's massive scale. The Game Awards 2024 drew an audience of 154 million livestreams, which was up from 118 million for The Game Awards 2023. This counts streams on YouTube, Twitch, Steam, TikTok, X, Instagram, Facebook, and international platforms like Bilibili and WeChat in China, among other sources. The viewership number for The Game Awards 2024 was many millions higher than the latest Super Bowl (127.7 million), but the comparison is not apples to apples. Super Bowl ads for Super Bowl LIX this past February reportedly cost as much as $8 million for 30 seconds. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
