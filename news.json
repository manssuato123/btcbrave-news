That means even games that weren't designed for Fortnite should work, and this move could pave the way for Epic to fully incorporate Fall Guys into Fortnite. \"Starting next year, Unity developers will be able to publish games directly into Fortnite to appear in Fortnite’s discovery system alongside games built with Unreal Engine and to participate in the Fortnite economy as it evolves towards an open metaverse economy connecting all users and all engines,\" Sweeney said Wednesday at Unity's Unite conference. This is major news for developers, who will be able to make things for Fortnite without using Epic's tools and may be able to import their existing games into Fortnite as well. And with the recent news that Epic will allow Creative maps to sell things for V-Bucks, these Unity devs might actually be able to sell their games in Fortnite. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "It's the most wonderful time of the year for Fortnite players who like free stuff. While Epic regularly offers free in-game items for completing quests or leveling up, the company tends to really ramp up its charitable giving toward the end of the year--and our first truly free skin of the season is Cuddle Team Rider, which you can earn as part of the Winter Rush event, which runs through the end of the season on November 29. The Cuddle Team Rider skin is free for those who complete nine of Fortnite's Winter Rush quests.This event is basically the same thing as previous \"Rush\" events. Each day, you'll have two new quests that require you to gain 80,000 XP (exactly one account level) in specific types of Fortnite experiences while in a party with at least one friend. Each quest completed unlocks one cosmetic, starting with the jam track Acelerada by MXZI--the Cuddle Team Rider skin will unlock once you've completed nine (9) of them. The other free rewards include an animated wrap, an emote, and a back bling and pickaxe that match Cuddle Team Rider. The quests alternate between making you play Epic-developed experiences and trying out various types of Fortnite Creative maps. On the first day, the two quests we have are to gain XP in Festival or Rocket Racing, and gain XP in Tycoon creator-made islands. The rest of the quests aren't yet available, but you can expect to find new ones each day. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The patch notes mostly detailed fixes for the game's campaign and Zombies mode, but stability improvements were included for multiplayer. The developer addressed a campaign issue that allowed some events to lose their progress when players left the activity area. Unfortunately, the patch notes didn't specify if this is for the campaign's Endgame mode or the objectives found in the actual campaign missions. However, it did mention a fix for an issue that previously caused players to get stuck on a black screen specifically when loading into Endgame. For Zombies, the update fixed the Equivalent Exchange augment for the Quick-Revive perk. Treyarch said the augment wasn't reviving downed players after dealing enough damage as intended, but it should be working properly now. It also corrected a visual bug that allowed Aether Shroud's afterimage to exist longer than intended. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Cain's answer--\"Yes, there is. Good question.\" Looking back at his own early years in the industry, he describes an era with only programmers and some artists, but no narrative designers, and far fewer competing priorities. In contrast, he says today's games \"try to be everything to everyone.\" In about 13 minutes, Cain explains how he attributes the sharp focus of early games to the era's severe technical limitations and fragmented hardware landscape. \"Games were being made for PC, for Apple, for Atari, for Commodore, for a wild assortment of consoles,\" he recalled, with no shared standards to ease development. Teams were small and multitasking was essential--programmers often acted as artists and sound designers, reverse-engineering undocumented hardware to make their games function. \"These games were really focused, because they had to be,\" he explained.

Now, EA's military shooter will seemingly no longer count the bots you kill in a match, but if you get blasted by a bot, that death will still show up in your stats sheet for now. According to a November 18 X post by the community news source Battlefield Bulletin, the update was deployed to make the game's stats accurate and fair. If you visit your profile page now, you may see a significant drop in your kill-death ratio, possibly suggesting that many of the kills in that stat were merely on bots. #Battlefield6 Backend Update: In order to make the stats accurate and fair, Battlefield Studios has removed bot kills from your K/D ratio via profile page. pic.twitter.com/k2DNa7c1xq — Battlefield Bulletin (@BFBulletin) November 18, 2025 Retired competitive pro player Otto \"ottr\" Boström highlighted this change on his X account, posting a side-by-side comparison of what appears to be his Battlefield 6 profile page on November 18. In one image, he had 88,838 kills, with a 92.950 average K/D. In the subsequent image, his kills dropped to 24,227, with his K/D falling to 3.814.

    "title": "How Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined Fixes The Original's \"Painful\" Slog",
    "description": "Dragon Quest is one of the most recognizable names in classic RPGs, and also one that has recently leaned heavily on the past to attract new fans. Square Enix has remastered the first three classic DQ games, dubbed the Erdrick Trilogy, and is now skipping ahead to the seventh installment with Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined. It's an unexpected move, but partially explained by DQ7 having such a notorious reputation among fans. Namely, it was a slog. Even its own key developers acknowledge that much, which made it ripe for a remake that trims the fat. I played a little over an hour of Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined and talked with producer Takeshi Ichikawa. My limited time was not enough to get a feel for the full scope of the cuts, but I was impressed by the other ways it's being modernized. It starts with the art style, which is immediately striking. Square Enix noted during a presentation that to establish the revised look, it constructed physical dolls for each of the major party members, giving them the ability to focus on small details like the texture of their clothing. Those dolls were then scanned in to act as digital puppets, and the rest of the game was developed to match their style. That gives it a handcrafted look that is, I dare say, cozy. The perspective is still primarily following your characters from above, as you'd expect in a classic RPG, but the character detail is readily apparent even there, and you get a closer look at them in cutscenes and battles. Ichikawa said that the doll-like art style was an homage to the late Akira Toriyama, the renowned manga artist who also created the visual style for all of the Dragon Quest games before his passing in 2024. When Toriyama designed the characters for DQ7, they were given a more \"cutesy, adorable aesthetic\" compared to other Dragon Quest games, with more squat designs that differed from his usual art. The company researched ways to maintain and update that visual style and found inspiration in other media, like movies and TV shows, that have used a doll motif. That inspired the creation of physical dolls to define the look, which he says helped create realistic fabrics and textures that influenced the overall style. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
