    "description": "Spoilers for this week’s episode of Fallout ahead. While last week focused on Lucy (Ella Purnell), Cooper Howard aka The Ghoul (Walton Goggins), and their pursuit of Hank (Kyle Maclachlan), this week we caught up with the newly knighted Maximus (Aaron Moten) and his chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel. We also got a peek into another faction of the Mojave Wasteland, one that could potentially spell danger for our protagonists and their questline. The episode opens up with a flashback to Shady Sands in its prime; A welcoming city that almost resembles life before The Great War. We open up on Maximus' parents in their lovely home where his father is testing the radiation levels in the water and discovers most of the water beneath the city is safe to drink and could provide a long term home for Shady Sands’ residents. Life is good until a traveling nomad muttering to himself arrives with an atomic bomb, putting the city in danger. Acting fast amongst the panic and chaos, Maximus' father attempts to disarm it but accidentally activates the bomb’s failsafe, starting the three minute timer to detonation. With little time to spare, he puts Maximus in the kitchen refrigerator and he along with his mother give a tearful goodbye before they’re killed in the blast. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "In early 2025, partway through a subathon to mark her second birthday, the AI VTuber Neuro-Sama became the world record holder for the largest Twitch Hype Train. Many claimed her achievements were possible thanks to Riot's competitive shooter, Valorant, gifting one subscription for each five gifted by the community. Now, only a few days into her third birthday subathon, Neuro-Sama and her creator Vedal987 have smashed that world record. She completed Hype Train level 120 with 118,989 subscriptions and 1,000,073 Bits gifted to the Vedal987 Twitch channel within a limited time. Neuro-Sama is an AI VTuber who recently completed a Minecraft Hardcore run with her creator and friends Filian and Crelly. She streams on Vedal's Twitch channel, and is powered by an artificial intelligence system that utilizes a large language model with vast capabilities. She can \"see\" games and respond to them, even being able to play some, she can read her Twitch chat and interact with viewers, and this week she's been playing around in virtual reality with her friends thanks to her new(ish) 3D model. Neuro-Sama debuted on Twitch on 19 December 2022, and each subsequent year on the same date she begins a subathon--a continuous stream that has its length determined by the number of subscriptions the community has gifted. When an abnormal number of subscriptions or Bits are gifted within a limited timeframe, a Hype Train is triggered, which shows an on-screen percentage, level, and how many subscriptions are required to progress to the next level. While Neuro-Sama met level 111 in January 2025, this time around she didn't need Valorant's help to decimate her own world record. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "I Hated Parrying, Until I Played Clair Obscur: Expedition 33",
    "description": "Parrying is about subtlety. It's the act of scrutinizing fisticuffs and sword fights with a furrowed brow, familiarizing yourself with the cadence of combat right down to milliseconds, and learning the precise moment of performing a counter attack. For instance, a small variation in animation may point to a rare opening. A slight note change in the audio cue may indicate a shift of attacks from the enemy. To parry well is to understand these details and adapt to them dexterously. That said, doing so is exhausting. The requirements needed to pull off a parry in most games can be steep and exacting. It's why I'd usually avoid parrying if there are other ways to minimize damage during combat, such as blocking or dodging. The painterly Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, one of my favorite RPGs this year, has been the exception. Within its dazzling combat system I've discovered the joy of parrying, every encounter an exhilarating sequence of silky-smooth attacks and ripostes. Fighting in Expedition 33 is a resplendent affair, thanks to its surprisingly in-depth and complex structure. Its skirmishes enhance JRPG-inspired turn-based combat with real-time elements that get players to dodge--and parry--at the right moment. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
