    "title": "The Xbox 360 Vs PS3 Console War Was A Race To 10 Million Sales, Ex-Xbox Exec Says",
    "description": "The era of console wars seems to be nearing its end, but one of its key players, Peter Moore, who led the charge during the launch of the Xbox 360, is sharing his memories of his time on the gaming frontlines. When it came to pitting the Xbox 360 against the PlayStation 3, Moore says 10 million was the magic number--\"You've got this flywheel effect ... of [if] your mate in the school yard's got one, you better get one.\" Speaking to Eurogamer, Moore explained that getting the Xbox 360 into the market ahead of the PS3 was key to its strong performance, saying that the first 10 million sales were vital. \"I think it was really important to get it out first,\" Moore said. \"Get going, get momentum, and aim for that 10 million installed base that I felt that would give us an amazing advantage over whatever Sony could do to catch up.\" He explained that having the 10 million install base creates a network effect where a sense of social pressure could drive sales--\"All of a sudden you're out of place and you're on the outside if you're not coming to school, or going to class in college the next day, or even coming to work, and saying what a night we had playing Halo, or whatever game it happened to be.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Ubisoft Posts Strong First-Half Growth And Teases Major Creative Shake-Up Coming In 2026",
    "description": "After a short delay, Ubisoft has posted its first-half earnings figures for 2025-2026. The company says that its Q2 net bookings exceeded expectations and its deal with Tencent to invest $1.2 billion in Vantage Studios--a new subsidiary focused on its three main franchises--is expected to close within a few days. Ubisoft says that its Q2 net bookings were up 39% year-on-year, driven by stronger-than-expected performance across its games catalogue and TV projects. The company had initially predicted that it would reach $520 million for its quarterly books, but this figure increased to $566.7 million. \"Our portfolio showed contrasting dynamics this quarter, with softer trends for Rainbow Six Siege, reflecting a phase of evolution for the game in an intense FPS environment, offset by strong performances across the rest of the catalog. The Assassin’s Creed franchise exceeded our expectations, confirming its positive momentum and ability to engage players over time. The Division 2 also continued to perform strongly, benefiting from the momentum of the Battle for Brooklyn DLC,\" Ubisoft Yves Guillemot said in a press release. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Bring Democracy To The Alien Hordes With This Helldivers 2 PS5 Black Friday Deal",
    "description": "Helldivers 2 $30 (was $40) See at Amazon See at PS Direct See at Walmart One of the biggest recent hits on PS5 has been Helldivers 2, a game best described as an online, PvE multiplayer third-person shooter with a satircal tone that melds Starship Troopers with Warhammer 40,000. If you haven't yet enlisted in Super Earth's war machine, you can finally join the fight with this Black Friday deal on the game, as it's down to $30 (was $40) for the sales event. This is a great excuse to check out the multiplayer shooter if you've been interested--and might be a good opportunity to convince a few friends to pick up the game and group up, too. This limited-time deal is available at Amazon, PlayStation Direct, and Walmart. Helldivers 2 $30 (was $40) Helldivers 2 has a simple but engaging premise. As one of Super Earth's defenders, it's up to you to bring the concept of Managed Democracy to worlds infested with vile alien species and marauding machines. How do you spread the good word? With guns, bombing runs, and well-placed tactical nuclear strikes deep in the heart of enemy territory. An always-online game, Helldivers 2 can be played solo or with fellow soldiers, and it receives constant updates that add new weapons to your arsenal and shiny cosmetics to collect. See at Amazon See at PS Direct See at Walmart Helldivers 2 sets itself apart in the live-service game genre by adopting a novel spin on in-game currencies. While you'll regularly earn rewards from successful missions and for taking part in community events, the premium in-game currency can also be earned simply by playing the game. While it does take longer than simply swiping your credit card and buying the resources, you can get everything that Helldivers 2 has to offer if you don't mind grinding away for it. Luckily, the game's battle passes don't expire, and you can unlock what you want from it when you want it, provided that you have enough points saved up. While it's multiplayer-only, the game's playerbase is large and active, and it's still easy to find others to play with, even over a year later. Even better, developer Arrowhead doesn't plan to stop supporting the title anytime soon, as it envisions it as a forever game like the legendary Runescape, so it appears Helldivers 2 will be around for quite a while.

Eve sets out to destroy the Elder Naytibas and reclaim Earth, while also carving a path forward through the Alpha Naytibas and their minions.
