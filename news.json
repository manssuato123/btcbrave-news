March of Giants is a 4v4 tactical multiplayer free-to-play MOBA inspired by technology from the early 1900s. The game combines elements of real-time strategy and lane-based combat.

It sounds like something out of a futuristic military video game, like Call of Duty. The defense ministry has announced that it's funding research and development at SWARM Biotactics to create technology that can \"steer cockroaches and send them on reconnaissance missions,\" CBS News reported. CEO Stefan Wilhelm said the cockroaches are \"super resilient\" and can crawl through \"tiny spaces,\" climb up walls, go into pipes, and navigate through rubble. How does this work? Neuroscientists at the company put electrodes on the critters' antennae to \"stimulate the insects' natural ability to navigate.\" They wear little backpacks carrying batteries and chips, with the bugs controlled through a game-style joystick. The researchers claim the cockroaches are not hurt by any of this. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
