Plenty of people have offered their thoughts about where the price may land, and now Linus Sebastian of Linus Tech Tips has shared what he says Valve told him during a recent meeting. On the WAN Show, Linus said he has no idea what the Steam Machine price will be, but in speaking to Valve, he came away thinking the system won't be priced similarly to a new console. \"When I said, 'I'm disappointed that it isn't going to follow a console pricing model where it's subsidized by the fact that the manufacturer is going to be taking 30% of every game sold on it over the lifespan of this thing, because I feel that would be a more meaningful product,' they kind of asked what I meant by, well, 'What do you mean by console price?' And I said, 'Well, $500,'\" he said, as reported by IGN. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Now, Prologue: Go Wayback! is officially entering early access today and giving players a chance to brave the elements from the comfort of their own homes. Prologue unfolds from a first-person perspective and drops players into a landscape that changes in every playthrough thanks to procedurally-generated maps. Even the weather can dramatically change, which forces you to make choices about how you're going to survive. Thirst, hunger, and body temperature all need to be maintained long enough for you to reach a weather tower. There are always multiple approaches for that goal, and plenty of ways to die if you make the wrong move. As part of the launch, PlayerUnknown Productions is introducing a handful of features. Players will be able to customize the weather, the temperature, and the time of day at the beginning of each playthrough, which can make the experience easier or harder.

As of today, November 20, Conquest matches now have an increased number of tickets--up from 1,000 to 1,200. The developer said it arrived at this change after watching feedback generally, along with \"win rates, balance, the impact of objective play, and more.\" The 1.1.2.0 update made changes to help push players to play the objective, and this has been working out so far, with more come-from-behind victories, among other positive results. However, these changes also led to matches ending \"sooner than intended,\" and to address this, Battlefield Studios is increasing the number of tickets. The developer said this should help with match length and retain the focus on playing the objective. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

You'll also find the Logitech G Astro A50 Wireless for $240 (was $300) and the Logitech G Astro A10 Gen 2 Wired Headset for $50 (was $70). Check out a full breakdown of the discounted headsets below, and be sure to browse GameSpot's Black Friday Deals Hub for price cuts on other PC gaming hardware, Blu-rays, books, and more. Logitech G Astro A50 X Wireless Headset $330 (was $400) The Logitech G Astro A50 X is the most luxurious of the trio of products on sale for Black Friday. Available in black or white, it supports PS5, Xbox, and PC, and you can switch between them simultaneously at the press of a button. You can also use it with Nintendo Switch while the console is docked. The main attraction, however, is unique HDMI 2.1 Passthrough technology, offering 24-bit/48kHz audio that should impress even the most discerning audiophile. Aside from its cool HDMI tech, the headset is equipped with everything else you'd expect from a $300+ gadget. This includes Pro-G Graphene audio drivers (40mm), the ability to listen to two devices at once, up to 24 hours of battery life, and a mobile app to help you optimize its performance. There's also an included docking station with LED lights that lets you quickly recharge your headset between play sessions. See at Amazon (White) See at Amazon (Black) Logitech G Astro A50 Wireless Headset $240 (was $300) This offers many of the same features as the A50 X, though it skips out on the HDMI Passthrough technology. Beyond that, you can still connect to PS5, Xbox, Switch, and PC, you'll still get Pro-G Graphene audio drivers (40mm), and you'll still get an included base station for charging. The same mobile app also lets you tweak a variety of settings like stream output mixing, mic settings, and other variables, and the overall design of the A50 is essentially the same as the A50 X. Note that if you're playing on PC, this will support the same 24-bit/48kHz as the A50 X. On console, performance drops to 16-bit/48kHz. In short, if you're playing just on PC, this is the headset to get. If you're playing on console, you'll have to decide if the slight performance bump of the A50 X is worth an extra $90. See at Amazon Logitech G Astro A10 Gen 2 Wired Headset $50 ($70) Just need a reliable headset that won't break the bank? Take a peek at the Logitech G Astro A10 Gen 2 now that it's just $50 (was $70). Its stat sheet won't blow you away, but priced at $50, it's a pretty good deal. The wired 3.5mm connection supports PS5, Xbox, Switch, and PC, a flip-to-mute microphone makes it easy to chat with teammates, and its 32mm drivers should be good enough for most casual players. Logitech built the headset to be durable too, with a flexible headband that can take a beating and oversized earcups that should be comfy during long play sessions. Several different colors and patterns are on sale--making it easy to find something that fits your style.

The PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch versions of the family-friendly platformer are all discounted to just $25 (was $40) at Amazon. We don't know how long this limited-time deal will last, so it's worth picking up while you still can. The Grinch: Christmas Adventures $25 (was $40) The Grinch: Christmas Adventures standard edition includes a boxed copy of the game. The full game data is included on the disc (or the cartridge, in the case of the Nintendo Switch). That said, unlike previous eras of gaming where you could simply pop a new game into your console and start playing right away, newer titles often need to install at least some game data to the console's hard drive, which can take several minutes. So if you're planning to give this to a family member, a pro move would be to open the case and insert the disc in the console so all the data is installed, then wrap the gift once it's complete so they can start playing right away. See at Amazon The Grinch: Christmas Adventures is a kid-friendly game that lets players explore Who-Ville as the Grinch, tackling platforming sections through the town's outskirts, snowboarding stunt sequences, jetpack challenges, and more. The Grinch's dog, Max, is also a playable character with his own unique missions, and the game is full of collectibles that let you unlock jigsaw puzzles, art, and Grinch-y accessories. The game first launched back in 2023, but has remained surprisingly popular with players, and it even received a new DLC expansion last month titled The Grinch: Christmas Adventures - Determined to Love Christmas. The expansion is available as a $10 premium download on the PlayStation Store, Xbox Store, and Nintendo eShop. There are plenty of other early Black Friday video game deals available at Amazon.

See at Amazon After a misstep with Battlefield 2042, DICE seems to be back on track with Battlefield 6. Our Battlefield 6 review gave it a 7/10, shouting out its impressive gunplay and new features like crouch sprinting and dragging downed enemies that add a new twist to the usual Battlefield formula. Battlefield 6 features both a single-player campaign and online multiplayer, but it's the latter that's earning the most praise. \"Battlefield 6 is a return to form, even if it doesn't reach the same highs as the series at its peak,\" wrote Richard Wakeling. \"The campaign is as lackluster as expected, and the multiplayer maps are only ever decent at best, but there's still a chaotic and super-satisfying shooter here that offers multiplayer thrills unlike any other. Even if you're not racking up kills by the dozens, you're still rewarded for contributing in other ways, and you're never too far away from being in the middle of a histrionic Battlefield moment.\" Plenty of other video games, Blu-rays, and more are on sale in Amazon's Black Friday sale.
