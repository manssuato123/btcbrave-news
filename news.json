    "title": "Get All 5 Mad Max Films On 4K Blu-Ray For Under $50",
    "description": "Mad Max 5-Film Collection (4K Blu-ray) $49.49 (was $80) See at Amazon Nothing beats finding a freshly wrapped 4K Blu-ray box set under the Christmas tree, and if you're looking to spoil someone who enjoys \"Ozsploitation\" movies, then check out this limited-time deal on the entire Mad Max film saga. This 4K Blu-ray bundle launched for $100 last year, but it's now discounted to its lowest price yet at $49.49 on Amazon. It also comes with digital copies of all five movies. This is an awesome deal on one of the most acclaimed action film series, but the price cut ends until 11:59 PM PT, so you only have a few more hours to take advantage of the deal. Mad Max 5-Film Collection (4K Blu-ray) $49.49 (was $80) Set in a dystopian future where society has broken down in the wake of resource and water wars, the box set includes Mad Max, Mad Max: The Road Warrior, Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, Mad Max: Fury Road, and Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga. The slipcase also pays tribute to the film series, featuring artwork showcasing various images of the bandits and the vehicles that hunted down Max and Furiosa throughout each movie. This collection includes a curated selection of special features pulled from previous Blu-ray releases. You can sit down for several behind-the-scenes documentaries, deleted scenes, and featurettes that explore the chaotic world of the film series. What makes this edition special is that it is the only 4K Blu-ray box set to include the physical Black &amp; Chrome editions of Fury Road and Furiosa. Both movies look stunning in black and white, as each film was re-graded to create striking images bereft of color. The only downside to this collection is that there are no special features included for Beyond Thunderdome. Mad Max fans will be used to this, since no bonus materials were included on the original DVD or on standard Blu-ray copies of the film.

The Totally Awesome '80s bundle is available for $55, and it includes Top Gun, Trading Places, The Untouchables, Beverly Hills Cop, and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Considered among the greatest blockbusters of that decade, each film also comes with a digital streaming copy and special features. Totally Awesome 80s (4K Blu-ray) $55 | Releases December 16 See at Amazon For even more vintage action, you can add The James Bond Collection of 24-film Blu-rays for only $55 (was $120), or if you're in the mood for some horror, the Amazon-exclusive Steelbook Edition of The Dead Zone on 4K Blu-ray is available for its lowest price yet.

    "description": "Earlier this year, Silent Hill f became the first game in the series to ditch the small American town that the series was named for in favor of setting it in Japan decades earlier. That approach may be used again for future titles in the franchise, according to developer Motoi Okamoto. \"We believe we could perhaps take similar approaches with other cultures across the globe,\" Okamoto told Inverse through a translator. \"For example, in Central or South America, we could perhaps tap into the more local, shamanistic beliefs and see how that ties in. But we could also try to expand our horizons and look into other regions, like possibly Russia, Italy, or South Korea, because all those areas have their own unique types of belief systems. I believe that will be a gateway for us to expand our concepts further.\" Okamoto appears to have put the most thought into the Central and South American locations, which he said have \"been affected by a lot of military governments and coups,\" before adding, \"There is a type of bravado and 'machismo' that comes from these political landscapes. There’s also the more folkloric angle coming from shamanism and local beliefs.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Now, a 92-year-old Japanese woman named Hisako Sakai has carved out her own legend in the King of the Iron Ring battles by winning a Tekken 8 tournament. As reported by Automaton, the tournament of senior citizen Tekken 8 players was put on by the Japanese eSports association Care. The mission statement of that organization is to \"create an environment in which the elderly can casually participate in eSports.\" Care has been running tournaments since 2019 while treating them like a major event with livestreaming and official commentators. A video from the event can be seen below. Sakai made it all the way to the finals while playing as Claudio, when she went up against 74-year-old player Goro Sugiyama, who used Lili as his character. The match between Sakai and Sugiyama can be found two hours and 25 minutes into the video above.

    "description": "Universal Classic Monsters: Complete 30-Film Collection (Blu-ray) $57.49 (was $85) See at Amazon Universal Classic Monsters: The Essential Collection (4K Blu-ray) $66 (was $91) See at Amazon If Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein has you interested in checking out some iconic horror flicks, you'll want to head over to Amazon before the end of the day. The retailer is currently offering a limited-time deal for Universal Classic Monsters: The Complete 30-Film Collection on Blu-ray, which pulls together 30 classic films for $57.49 (was $85). If you prefer 4K Blu-ray, Universal Classic Monsters: The Essential Collection gets you eight icons for $66 (was $91). Both deals are set to end at 11:59 PM PT, so snag them while you can. Universal Classic Monsters: Complete 30-Film Collection (Blu-ray) $57.49 (was $85) This bundle gets you an impressive 30 films released between 1931 and 1956. These are spread across eight collections revolving around Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, The Wolf Man, The Invisible Man, Phantom of the Opera, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Each one is a complete collection, ensuring you have all the classic films in one place. Aside from the old films on Blu-ray, this bundle is packed with bonus content, including: Behind-the-scenes documentaries 1931 Spanish version of Dracula Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Lon Chaney Jr., and Jack Pierce featurettes 13 expert feature commentaries Archival footage Production photographs Theatrical trailers Better yet, you'll get a 48-page collectible book alongside the Blu-rays, giving you a chance to dive deeper into the films while away from the screen. For something a bit smaller, check out the Hammer Horror 8-Film Collection. On sale for $17 (was $36), it pulls together Brides of Dracula, The Phantom of the Opera, The Curse of the Werewolf, Night Creatures, Paranoiac, The Kiss of the Vampire, Nightmare, and The Evil of Frankenstein into a single collection. See at Amazon Universal Classic Monsters: The Essential Collection (4K Blu-ray) $66 (was $91) This collection offers many of the same bonus features as the Blu-ray bundle, but it only includes eight films: Dracula Frakenstein The Mummy The Invisible Man The Bride of Frankenstein The Wolf Man Phantom of the Opera Creature from the Black Lagoon Offered in 4K Blu-ray and benefiting from support for Dolby Audio, this is arguably the best way to enjoy these old movies on modern screens. Another bundle, Universal Classic Monsters: Icons of Horror Collection, is also on sale for $35 (was $43). It's a bit smaller than the above 4K collection, featuring just Dracula, Frankenstein, The Invisible Man, and The Wolf Man. But at this new low price, it's worth consideration if you don't mind missing out on a few hits.

    "description": "The conventional wisdom is that Kinect was an albatross on Xbox One, making the system more expensive at launch and taking away resource power. But now, over a decade later, the Kinect-like Nex Playground has outsold Xbox hardware for November in the US, according to Circana. Nex Playground came in third for hardware units sold last month, outpacing Xbox Series X|S. The only saving grace is that Xbox raked in more dollar sales, as Nex Playground retails for $250 but has been on sale for $200 over the holiday season. Overall, video game hardware sales were pretty bleak, reaching a low not seen since November 1995. Top 10 Best-Selling Video Games Of All Time See More This might not be a total shock for those paying attention. Nex Playground actually outsold every PS5 and Xbox console bundle for a week last month in the US. The cube-shaped console features a camera to track body movements, similar to Kinect. Five games are pre-installed, with the option to purchase a subscription Play Pass for a larger library of games. It's $49 for three months or $89 for a year. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
