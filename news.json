Thankfully, Target still has units available for the same price. The bundle comes with nine Play Booster Packs, an Alternate-Art Foil Promo Card, 30 Basic Land Cards, a Spider-Man-themed storage box, and a few other items.

    "description": "While Sony and Nintendo have expanded their lead over Xbox, a dark horse console had a very strong showing in third place in November. The Nex Playground has emerged as a breakout hit, and CEO David Lee believes that one of the reasons why its been so successful is because the console has solved the Wii \"problem.\" Nearly two decades ago, the Wii powered Nintendo's post-GameCube comeback with its motion controls and unique games. Lee argues that the scope of Wii's success made it difficult to sustain in the long term. Instead of trying to sell games like Wii, Nex Playground is offering its titles as part of a subscription service. \"One of the most important things we should do is learn from history and try not to commit the same limitations, and that's why we have a subscription model,\" Lee told The Game Business. \"Nintendo expanded the audience with Wii. When you expand the audience, and they want different things, and they only buy Wii Fit, Wii Sports and not many others … that's a bit of a problem.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Save Up To 25% On The Akira Manga Hardcover Edition",
    "description": "Akira Hardcover Collection Save Up To 25% See all volumes at Amazon Any list gathering up the best that anime has to offer will inevitably include Akira, and for good reason. The 1988 movie raised the bar for film animation and is widely credited with introducing mainstream audiences outside Japan to the medium. However, the anime adaptation is only part of the tale. Like innumerable other anime projects, Akira is adapted from a much longer--though lesser-known--manga series. While the Akira manga has been available in print for decades, a new Akira Hardcover Edition kicked off earlier in 2025, offering the most authentic presentation of Katsuhiro Otomo's groundbreaking sci-fi saga. If you've ever wanted to experience the full Akira saga, this is one of the best ways to do so--and as luck would have it, you can save a few dollars on these premium hardcover releases. Four volumes in the six-volume series are available to purchase at Amazon, and while these normally cost between $30 and $40, you can get them for up 25% off. Volumes 5 and 6 are also launching in the coming weeks, and preorders are live. Akira Hardcover Collection Save Up To 25% The Akira Hardcover books published by Kodansha use the updated translation and lettering of the 35th Anniversary Edition box set, and each book is presented as a large-sized 7\" x 10\" collectible. Like traditional manga, they are read from right to left, and the original Japanese-language hand-drawn sound effects from the manga have been restored. Each hardcover book has cover artwork based on the original manga tankabon volume artwork. As mentioned above, four volumes have launched so far, and are currently discounted to roughly $26 - $27 at Amazon (normally $30 - $35 each). The next release, Akira Hardcover Collection 5, releases on December 23. Preorders are discounted to $34 (down from $36). This will be followed by Akira Hardcover Collection 6, a month later on January 27, 2026. Preorders for volume six are available for $40. Check out all the Akira Hardcover Collection releases below. Akira Hardcover Collection 1 -- $26.61 ($35) Akira Hardcover Collection 2 -- $26.61 ($35) Akira Hardcover Collection 3 -- $25.70 ($30) Akira Hardcover Collection 4 -- $27.61 ($35) Akira Hardcover Collection 5 -- $34 ($36) | Releases December 23 Akira Hardcover Collection 6 -- $40 | Releases January 27, 2026 See all volumes at Amazon While the hardcover editions above are fresh reprints, you can also pick up all six of them as part of the Akira 35th Anniversary Manga Box Set. All six volumes come bundled together with the hardcover Akira Club art book and an exclusive pill patch. It's currently sold out, but it gets restocked periodically at Amazon, so it's worth checking back to see if it's available. Set in a dark future timeline, Akira first began publication in 1982 and ran for 120 chapters. Taking place in the post-apocalyptic city of Neo-Tokyo, the series examines the after-effects of a mysterious explosion that almost destroyed the city. Thirty years later, teenage biker gang leader Shotaro Kaneda finds himself in the middle of a plot that involves militant revolutionaries, psychically gifted individuals, military forces, and his childhood friend, Tetsuo Shima, who has begun to develop dangerously destructive psychic powers of his own. Akira manga was critically acclaimed for its mature themes, well-developed characters, intriguing storylines, and Otomo's artwork. In the years since its publication, it's become regarded as one of the pioneering works in the then-burgeoning Cyberpunk sci-fi subgenre. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Totally Awesome 80s Box Set (4K) $55 The Totally Awesome 80s Box Set compiles 4K Blu-ray editions of five classic movies released by Paramount Pictures throughout the 1980s: Beverly Hills Cop Ferris Bueller's Day Off Top Gun Trading Places The Untouchables That's a nice selection of some of the decade's most notable action, comedy, and drama flicks. The 4K Blu-ray releases for each film support Dolby Vision, HDR10, and Dolby Atmos audio, and offer their own selection of bonus materials, including new behind-the-scenes documentaries, deleted scenes, music videos, audio commentary tracks, and more.

Ferris Bueller's Day Off, one of John Hughes' best films, follows Bueller (Mathew Broderick), his girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara), and his best bud Cameron (Alan Ruck) as they take an unscheduled break from school. The Untouchables is a ruthless turn-of-the-century gangster movie with an all-star cast, while Trading Places saw John Landis put his own spin on Wall Street, and Beverly Hills Cop is a breakout action-comedy hit that made Eddie Murphy a household name.

    "description": "MTG Avatar: The Last Airbender Beginner Box $27 (was $35) See at Amazon MTG Avatar: The Last Airbender Play Booster Box $135 (was $209.70) See at Amazon MTG Avatar: The Last Airbender Collector Booster Box $375 (was $455.88) See at Amazon Avatar: The Last Airbender fans and Magic: The Gathering collectors can save big on several products from the franchise's recently released Universes Beyond MTG set. All three booster boxes are steeply discounted. The Play Booster Box, which has 30 packs with 14 cards each, is down to $135 (was $209.70). The Collector Booster Box has received an $80 discount, dropping the price to $375. You'll get 12 Collector Booster Packs with 15 cards each. Individual Collector Boosters are selling for $49, but buying in bulk lowers the cost of each pack to $31.25. The Jumpstart Booster Box, which has 24 packs with 20 cards each, is available for $120 (was $167.76). The other notable Avatar: The Last Airbender MTG deal is the Beginner Box for $27 (was $35).

    "title": "Pokemon TCG Mega Charizard Ultra-Premium Collection Drops To $140 At Amazon",
    "description": "Pokemon TCG: Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection $140 (was $250) See at Amazon Mega Venusaur ex Premium Collection $74.89 See at Amazon Amazon has dropped the price of the Pokemon Trading Card Game's latest Ultra-Premium Collection. After initially restocking the Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection with a $165 asking price, Amazon is now selling the large collection of boosters and promo cards for $140. The Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection had sold for as high as $250 before launch and was $211 on launch day (November 14). It launched alongside Pokemon TCG's latest expansion set, Mega Evolution - Phantasmal Flames. Pokemon TCG collectors can also pick up the newly released Mega Venusaur ex Premium Collection for $74.89 at Amazon. Released earlier this month, the latest Mega Pokemon Premium Collection has been difficult to find in stock, so we wouldn't be surprised if it sold out again soon. Speaking of Premium Collections, the Lugia ex &amp; Latias ex Premium Collection is back in stock for $100. Amazon also has a brand-new Pokemon TCG listing that has yet to be noticed by resellers. The Holiday 2025 Poke Ball Tins are available to order for $30 each. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
