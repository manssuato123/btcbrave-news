The 10% discount only shaves three bucks from the price, but the Spider-Verse minifigures have largely been sold out at other retailers.

Single Spider-Verse minifigures are priced at $5, but every major retailer and the Lego Store are sold out of singles. Amazon has marked this as a Cyber Monday deal, so it may disappear at 12 AM PT (December 2). But unlike most of Amazon's Cyber Monday Lego deals, the store page doesn't have a countdown clock, so it could stick around after the sale ends.

    "title": "The 4K Nvidia Shield TV Pro Is Back Down To Its Lowest-Ever Price",
    "description": "Nvidia Shield TV Pro $170 (was $200) See at Amazon See at Best Buy If you're interested in cloud gaming and streaming, the Nvidia Shield TV Pro is arguably one of the best options available in 2025. It's a powerful little piece of hardware, letting you access GeForce Now along with all your favorite streaming platforms (like Netflix and Disney+). Normally a bit pricey at $200, Amazon and Best Buy are matching its lowest price ever of $170 for Cyber Monday--but since the sales end at 11:59 PM PT on December 1, you'll want to snag one soon before the limited-time offer disappears. Nvidia Shield TV Pro $170 (was $200) The Nvidia Shield TV Pro is an all-around streaming monster. This model includes the new Shield Remote, offering backlit buttons, a built-in microphone for voice commands, and even a lost remote locator feature (so you'll know exactly which cushion it slipped behind). The main attraction, however, is the box itself, which features some nice hardware. Here's a quick look at its specs: Nvidia Tegra X1+ processor (256-core GPU and 3GB RAM) 16GB storage (expandable) AI-upscaling for 4K 60fps Dolby Atmos support Dolby Vision support Gigabit Ethernet port HDMI 2.0 2x USB 3.0 Ports (Type A) Android 11 with Chromecast 4K built-in For gaming, you'll have access to Google Play Games and GeForce Now. That makes this a pretty cool central entertainment hub, offering you a chance to stream not just TV shows and movies, but also games. See at Amazon See at Best Buy If you like the concept of the Nvidia Shield TV Pro but want to save a few extra bucks, take a peek at its more affordable sibling--the standard Nvidia Shield TV. It comes with a similar Nvidia Tegra X1+ processor, though it's equipped with 2GB RAM instead of 3GB. You'll also lose out on the USB 3.0 ports and see a drop from 16GB of storage to just 8GB. However, at $125 (was $150), it might be a good choice for frugal shoppers. Another cloud gaming option is the Fire TV Stick 4K Max + Luna Controller Bundle, which is on sale for $70 (was $130) at Amazon. The Luna Controller is surprisingly great--especially when streaming with Luna--as it helps reduce input latency and is quite comfortable for extended gaming sessions. Note that these Fire TV Sticks all support Xbox Cloud Gaming. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "These Customizable Pixel Art Speakers Are A Stylish Retro-Themed Gift Idea",
    "description": "Retro Pixel Art Bluetooth Speaker $70 (was $90) See at Amazon If you're shopping for a quirky last-minute holiday gift, this adorable Retro Pixel Art Bluetooth Speaker needs to be on your radar. Amazon has it listed for one of its best prices of the year right now, and since the customizable speaker also serves as an alarm clock and white noise machine, it's a fun purchase at $70 (was $90). Amazon's discount started on Black Friday and continues through Cyber Monday; however, the Cyber Monday event ends at 11:59 PM PT on December 1, so you have just a few more hours to cash in on this offer. Retro Pixel Art Bluetooth Speaker $70 (was $90) Available in five different styles (all of which are on sale), the Retro Pixel Art Bluetooth Speaker is quite popular with buyers. Sitting with nearly 11,000 reviews on Amazon, it's holding down an impressive 4.6 stars. Along with serving as a Bluetooth speaker, you can customize the pixel art on its display using the attached mini keypad. There's also a companion app where you can quickly adjust your settings--or download artwork from other users. So even if you're not the most artistic person on the planet, you can still get a fun design for the speaker. See at Amazon For playing music, you can connect via Bluetooth, USB, or microSD card. Beyond looking adorably retro and blasting tunes, the device also works as a white noise machine, a timer, and an alarm clock with 12 wake-up sounds. And since it gets around 8 hours of battery life on a charge, you can use it throughout your home before needing to plug in at night. Retro Pixel Art Bluetooth SpeakersThe same company responsible for the Retro Pixel Art Bluetooth Speaker also makes a few other cool speakers. A cheaper alternative is the Classic Gaming PC Style Speaker, which is just $56 (was $70). It's designed to look like (surprise!) a retro computer, though its display isn't designed for pixel art. Instead, you can use it as a digital picture frame. There's also the TimeBox Evo, which offers a similar pixel grid as that of the Retro Pixel Art Speaker, but it's housed inside a minimalist black frame. It's available for $38.20 (was $70).

    "description": "Sony's hit video game franchise Helldivers is heading to the big screen, and it'll be driven by the man who directed five out of the 10 Fast &amp; Furious movies: Justin Lin. The project has already lined up a screenwriter as well: Gary Dauberman, a writer whose experience includes the It movies and the Annabelle films. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Lin will produce the movie through his Perfect Storm Entertainment company. The story also notes that Lin used his inexperience as a gamer as a way to pitch Sony on a take that will \"find the humanity in the characters and weave timely themes into the story, while building out a world and mythology.\" Lin has been credited with reviving the Fast &amp; Furious films with The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. While that movie was a success, he led the franchise to even bigger hits with Fast &amp; Furious, Fast Five, Fast &amp; Furious 6, and F9: The Fast Saga. Lin's lone sci-fi film was 2016's Star Trek Beyond. Lin is also signed to adapt the One-Punch Man manga and anime as a movie. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "From Software is very careful about setting expectations when it comes to the DLC expansions for its games, favoring the underpromise and overdeliver approach. This much is reflected in the messaging around The Forsaken Hollows, Elden Ring Nightreign's first DLC expansion. When I pointed out a similarity I felt it had to Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, the team made sure to clarify that the comparison was not quite apt and players shouldn't expect something on that level. The Forsaken Hollows is billed as a couple of new Nightfarers for players to pick between, along with new points of interest to give players a reason to jump back into Limveld and take on the Nightlords. That's an accurate summation of it, but also somewhat undersells that the two new Nightfarers are very cool and create interesting new ways to think about and play the game; the new biomes come in the form of swamps (yes, they're back) that make the threat of status effects more prominent; and there are multiple new mini-bosses and third-day bosses to take on. But the real underselling pertains to the new Shifting Earth event, which is essentially a brand new map that's distinct from Limveld, as opposed to a much smaller scale change in the environment that we're used to expecting.
