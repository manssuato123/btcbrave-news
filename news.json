    "description": "After giving everyone a free Juice WRLD skin a year ago, Fortnite is once again offering a free licensed skin to mark the start of a new chapter. Anyone who logs into Fortnite between November 27 at 6 AM PT and December 1 at 6 AM PT will receive a skin based on Yuki Yubari, a character from Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill who didn't make the final cut of the movie when it was originally released. This Yuki Yubari skin is free to anyone who logs into Fortnite between November 27 and December 1.Back when Tarantino wrote his massive two-part epic Kill Bill, it included an additional sequence that was cut before filming, in which Yuki seeks revenge for the death of her sister Gogo, whom The Bride had killed during the battle at the House of Blue Leaves. Yuki finally sees the light of day in Fortnite Chapter 7, apparently. The Yuki Yubari skin is not actually in the Fortnite game files yet, so you won't be granted the skin until after Chapter 7 begins on November 29. Yuki is one of at least three Kill Bill-related skins coming to Fortnite in Chapter 7. The Bride herself will be included in the Chapter 7 Season 1 battle pass, and a skin based on Gogo Yubari will be sold in the item shop--and you can also earn it by purchasing a ticket in advance for a showing of Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair during its opening weekend.

    "description": "This may be the winter of discontent for some Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 players. Activision has been notably quiet about the game's sales, and has yet to share metrics or statistics. There's also been an uptick in anger from fans over conspiracy issues related to the game's Skill-Based Matchmaking mode. That's led Charlie Olson--the creator of CoD's SBMM--to directly address some of those concerns himself. OIson--who spent a decade at Raven Software under Activision--shared a lengthy video on his YouTube channel that dives into how his SBMM is supposed to work. He also took the time to explain why Activision's announcement about bringing \"open matchmaking\" to Black Ops 7 didn't mean the game was dropping SBMM. If fans were expecting the chance to cut down inexperienced or casual players, they've been disappointed. Olson argues that it means the game has been dominated by \"sweats,\" or experienced players, rather than rookie players. \"Some players are leaving because they thought this tweet meant SBMM had been completely removed from the game, and then they felt betrayed by the inclusion of one standard matchmaking playlist, and then blamed it for stealing 'fodder' from the open playlist,\" explained Olson. \"What's really going on here is there aren't enough casual players at launch to make open matchmaking the pubstomp that was expected or promise. If open lobbies are sweaty, it's because it's mostly sweats playing.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Whether you recently picked up the new Nintendo Switch 2 or are looking for something to play on the original Switch, you'll want to check out Best Buy's Black Friday sale, as numerous games for both systems are on sale during the event. The deals include price cuts on physical Switch and Switch 2 games, as well as discounts on digital edition Switch games. The Switch 2 deals are focused on third-party releases like Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion for $50 (was $70) or EA Sports FC 26 for $30 (was $70), while the list of discounted Switch titles covers a mix of first- and third-party games, including up to 50% off on select Nintendo-published games like Super Mario Odyssey and Splatoon 3, both of which are $30 (normally $60). Considering Nintendo first-party releases rarely go on sale--and when they do, it's not by much--this is a great chance to stock up on Switch games for the holidays. And since Switch games are backwards compatible with the Switch 2--and in some cases have Switch 2 upgrades available--they could make great gifts for players of either console.

His memorable commentary on the game became part of NBA Jam's blockbuster success in arcades. However, Kitzrow has revealed that he was paid a very small amount for his work in the first game. While speaking with The Escapist, Kitzrow disclosed that he was paid $50 an hour for his work on NBA Jam, which was the same amount of money he made recording lines for Bally Midway's pinball machines. It wasn't until after the game was released that Kitzrow realized that he should have charged more. \"I'd go in, do a couple of sessions, maybe 15 hours total, and that was it,\" recalled Kitzrow. \"I wasn't smart enough, savvy enough to know the business, to go, 'Gee, these games make a lot of money, maybe I should make more than $50 an hour.' I didn't have an agent at the time ... When the game came out and I found out it made a billion dollars, that's when I realized I'd made like $800 and change ... I thought, 'Well, I'm probably being underpaid, I might want to raise my rate.'\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 received a small update on November 25, and the patch notes revealed a much-needed fix for the campaign's Endgame mode. The update added a new protection for disconnects that previously caused players to lose all of their progress in the mode. Black Ops 7's Endgame works much like the high-risk/high-reward structure of extraction-style shooters. Players grind matches of Endgame to level up their characters' abilities and combat rating, and failing to successfully extract from the map means they lose everything. Unfortunately, players were losing everything to random disconnects and game crashes as well. Treyarch said it heard the feedback from players, and the new update adds a disconnect protection. Now when players drop into matches of Endgame, the game snapshots the player's Combat Rating at the start of the match. This means players will keep their progress that was snapshotted at the start of the match even if a disconnect or crash occurs. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

TimeSplitters, TimeSplitters 2, and TimeSplitters: Future Perfect were a trio of well-liked FPS titles created in the early 2000s by UK developer Free Radical. The developer was working on TimeSplitters 4 when it went bankrupt in 2008 and was later absorbed by Crysis developer Crytek. A few years later in 2013, Crytek gave its official blessing to a TimeSplitters fan project looking to keep the franchise alive, even going so far as to provide original TimeSplitters assets for the project. The IP would later be transferred to THQ Nordic (now part of the Embracer Group), which honored Crytek's original agreement for the fan project, even as it briefly resurrected Free Radical with the intent on bringing the TimeSplitters franchise back to life.
