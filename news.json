Minecraft Blast is a free-to-play mobile game that combines match puzzles with a Minecraft-themed world that you can continually upgrade. Mojang and King describe it as a \"delightfully blocky puzzle adventure,\" and promise \"fun and challenging\" match puzzles that grant rewards that can be used to build structures and items. From the screenshots and footage we've seen so far, it looks like you'll have to clear blocks--some of which may be familiar to existing Minecraft players, such as TNT--which then grants energy or currency that can be used to purchase structures or items to place in your world. We've also spotted some familiar Minecraft mobs, including Chickens, Zombies, and Creepers. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "This was the Kirby Air Ride match where legends were born. Two players faced off on the streets of City Trial, each maneuvering Kirby with precision. One player had assembled what seemed to be an unstoppable, legendary machine--a combination of three difficult-to-collect pieces that granted a huge advantage. The other player gambled, taking a risky move in striking the machine and destroying it before the match ended. Against all odds, the underdog seized the win. It was a comeback rarely seen in the tight knit Kirby Air Ride community that's been riding Warp Stars for more than five years. This wasn’t just a match--it was a demonstration of the skill, strategy, and intuition that fuels the Kirby Air Ride community. Now, with Kirby Air Riders on the horizon, that community is buzzing louder than ever. The promise of a new official release has fans analyzing trailers and previews, debating which abilities will dominate, and counting down the days until they can prove themselves within the City Trial. \"There was no easy way to play Kirby Air Ride competitively before 2017. Kirby Air Ride wasn't seen as viable,\" Kirby Air Ride caster Betokirby tells GameSpot. \"Then you see UnclePunch working with others to make the HackPack. The HackPack is where competitive Kirby Air Ride started.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "There's A Free New Fortnite Skin You Probably Can't Get",
    "description": "Usually, Fortnite players like it when Epic Games offers a free skin. But that's not the case for Freediver, a new skin that's available for free only through the Priority app, which offers various deals and rewards to customers of UK mobile providers O2 and Virgin Media. O2 and Virgin members can use the Priority app to claim a code that'll let them unlock the skin by gaining a couple account levels. O2 and Virgin Media customers in the UK can unlock the Freediver skin for free in the Priority app. Having a skin locked to specific regional mobile providers means that most of the people in the world cannot get this skin. Not that they'd probably notice, since it's a fairly basic and not particularly interesting skin. But for folks who seriously collect Fortnite skins, that scarcity is a large part of its appeal--having this skin hypothetically offers a little bit of metaverse cred, since it's not something everyone can even get. We'll probably be seeing more of this, however, because this is the second time this year Epic has done this exact thing. Back in August, Epic offered a purple version of this same skin--dubbed Thrilldiver--only to users of the Brazilian telecom company Vivo. It's likely that this free skin is part of Epic's renewed push for mobile players, and that more recolors of this skin will be offered to other groups of mobile customers.

One such deal is for the 17-inch interactive Stitch plush from Just Play, which is down to $50 (was $70) for a limited time. The 17-inch figure moves and speaks with over 100 voice lines, making for a life-like gift for fans of the movie. You can check out more info on the deal below, as well as see a few more Lilo and Stitch toys and collectibles that are on sale at Amazon. Disney's Stitch 17-inch Interactive Plush $50 (was $70) This life-sized interactive plush is inspired by the live-action remake of Lilo &amp; Stitch that premiered earlier this year. It comes with six AA batteries to power its over 100 sound bites and motion features, and can be activated in multiple spots: touch his nose, tongue, belly, and left hand to get him moving and talking. A similar 17-inch interactive plush figure for Angel--the pink alien of the same species as Stitch who first debuted in the Lilo &amp; Stitch animated series that ran from 2003 to 2006--is also available. This one isn't on sale, so expect to pay the full $70 for her, but she has all the same features as the Stitch figure, and is worth considering as a companion for Stitch in your collection. See at Amazon Stitch Interactive Plush (14in.) $30 (was $46) If the 17-inch version is a bit too expensive, there's also a 14-inch interactive Stich plush on sale for just $30 (was $46). This one features over 50 sounds and effects and light-up LED eyes that can be changed to different styles at the push of a button. The doll comes with three AA batteries. See at Amazon If your loved one still enjoys the movies and is more of a LEGO fan, they're in luck. LEGO has a handful of impressively detailed sets pulled straight from the films. The buildable Stitch and Angel figures are to-scale versions of the characters, complete with props and modular mobility. The Beach House set is a faithful recreation of the titular family's house made up of over 800 pieces. All three sets are also currently on sale for up to 20% off as part of Amazon's Black Friday deals.
