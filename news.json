    "description": "Microsoft and Asus have rolled out a new update for the ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X, with the primary focus on default game profiles. That's the descriptor for titles to not only run well themselves, but to make sure the handheld is running efficiently as well--without owners having to tinker with settings. On Xbox Wire, the highlighted example for how default game profiles will work with ROG Xbox Ally handhelds is demonstrated with Hollow Knight: Silksong. By enacting the setting after the update, the metroidvania game should gain \"nearly an hour of battery life compared to performance mode while still delivering smooth 120fps gameplay.\" Default game profiles are starting in preview with 40 titles available, including Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, Doom: The Dark Ages, and Halo: The Master Chief Collection. Other improvements as part of the Xbox-branded handheld update are faster loading for your games library and \"improved gamepad response after login.\" In addition, Microsoft and Asus have teased future tweaks for the devices. They want to enhance \"sleep and wake reliability\" as well as add AI-powered automatic super resolution, for instance. Additionally, next week the plan is to introduce a game-save-sync indicator so you know when your progress is properly stored in the cloud to use on another system. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The trading card game ecosystem has become very crowded in recent years. Longtime stalwarts, like Pokemon and Magic: The Gathering, have been joined by One Piece, Disney Lorcana, and Gundam all in the last three years, and more companies are entering the space quickly. The most recent name to throw its cards on the table (literally) is Riot Games with Riftbound, a trading card game centered around the champions and worlds of the ultra-popular League of Legends. Its first set, Origins, released late last month, and has already been deemed a massive sales success. Yet based on the recent Riftbound PAX Unplugged panel, it seems as though this is just the beginning of Riot's big plans for the game moving forward--and they want everyone to be a part of them. According to Riftbound head designer Dave Guskin, there's one simple reason why Riftbound is so appealing (and easy to play) for new players: It was designed for everyone. \"We designed Riftbound, first and foremost, to be an easy game to get into with your friends,\" Guskin said. \"It's really welcoming to those who are familiar with other TCGs, and if you love League, we have done a lot to try to make the champions feel here the way they feel there.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

There's a Greatsword of Light and a Spear of the Upper Guard you can equip to the mysterious golem and warriors of various races. And you have Zelda and Calamo's new Sync Strike, which apparently sees Calamo throw a boomerang that Zelda will call back with the power of time, as well as a Sync Strike with the Block Golem, which is this powerful spinning attack that knocks down weak enemies.

Nintendo says that the version 21.0.1 update fixes two error codes that occur on a Nintendo Switch 1 when attempting a system transfer to a Nintendo Switch 2 through local communication. The more prevalent note is a fix for when \"wireless controllers or Bluetooth audio devices were unable to connect\" after waking a Switch 2 up from Sleep mode or turning off Airplane mode. While the Bluetooth wireless connectivity problem was not widely reported, several users on Reddit shared that they experienced issues with their Bluetooth headsets and expressed joy over the patch. Switch 2 owners also pointed out that after the 21.0.1 patch, the Switch 1 version of the fan-favorite Nier: Automata now functions properly on Switch 2 after having compatibility issues.

    "description": "One of the biggest year-end questions people have about the gaming industry this year is whether or not Battlefield 6 will outsell Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, a feat that would end a 20-year run of Call of Duty's dominance. It remains to be seen if that will happen, and while we wait for the data to come in, Circana's Mat Piscatella has shared some data points about the shooter category in the US. To begin with, Piscatella pointed out that the last shooter game to outsell a Call of Duty title in the US over a full year was Gears of War in 2006. The last FPS to beat Call of Duty was Star Wars: Battlefront II in 2005. Call of Duty has reigned supreme in the US not just in the shooter and FPS categories, but generally as well. A Call of Duty game has finished the year as the best-selling title for 13 of the past 16 years, the exceptions being 2013 (GTA 5), 2018 (Red Dead Redemption II), and 2023 (Hogwarts Legacy).

Players only have a limited time to experience the eerie Crystal Cave and discover its secrets, however, as the AoT quest is only available from November 25 to December 22. The new mission brings protagonists Naoe and Yasuke to the mysterious Crystal Cave, where dark experiments threaten to unleash a new type of threat on feudal Japan. Explore the cave's depths and stop a mysterious cult from turning their kidnapped Titan-Shifter into a major problem. The new quest is available to all players who have unlocked Yasuke as a playable character, and can be unlocked by talking to quest-giver Ada in the Yamashiro region, North of Hanazo Tower. Players will be able to loot new cosmetics for their hideout throughout the quest, and will be rewarded upon completion with a new crystal katana for Naoe. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Now, reports suggest Fortnite's plans with Paramount go beyond just SpongeBob, with \"many\" other Paramount franchises lined up for the battle royale game. Alongside the Simpsons season launch on November 1, Epic introduced the new Sidekicks feature to Fortnite--small pet or minion creatures that follow players around. Regular Fortnite leaker SamLeakss has now reported that \"many\" Paramount-owned characters will soon be coming to the game as Sidekicks. There's no information yet on the characters or series that might be included, but Paramount has a huge roster of popular franchises, with its portfolio including both Nickelodeon and Comedy Central. Some of its biggest series include SpongeBob SquarePants, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Transformers, South Park, Dora the Explorer, and Paw Patrol--though it seems unlikely that the franchises aimed at younger kids will be added to a video game like Fortnite.
