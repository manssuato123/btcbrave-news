    "title": "Asus ROG Xbox Ally Gets $110 Discount At Amazon",
    "description": "Asus ROG Xbox Ally Gaming Handheld $490 (was $600) Get deal at Amazon See at Walmart See at Best Buy See at Target The Asus ROG Xbox Ally is on sale for its lowest price yet at Amazon. Normally $600, the official Xbox gaming handheld is up for grabs for only $490 for a limited time. It's unclear when this deal ends, but you'll also find the recently released handheld on sale at Walmart ($499), Best Buy ($500), and Target ($550). This isn't the first time the Xbox Ally has received a discount. On November 29, Best Buy and Amazon discounted the device to $500. That deal was only available for three hours as a Black Friday flash deal, so it was easy to miss. If you pick up the Xbox Ally at Amazon, you should also check out some of the third-party accessories available now, including docking stations, screen protectors, travel cases, and microSD UHS-II cards. Asus ROG Xbox Ally Gaming Handheld $490 (was $600) The ROG Xbox Ally is an entry-level Windows gaming handheld with impressive features and performance for the price. The Ryzen Z2 A chip is comparable to Steam Deck's custom AMD APU, and if you increase the TDP--at the expense of battery life--the Xbox Ally can outperform the Steam Deck OLED. For reference, the Steam Deck OLED 512GB model retails for $549. The Xbox Ally has a 1920 x 1080p IPS display with 120Hz refresh rate and support for VRR and AMD FreeSync Premium. If you're comparing to the Steam Deck OLED, Valve's handheld has a 7.4-inch 1280 x 800p OLED display with HDR and 90Hz refresh rate. So the Steam Deck wins in panel type and size, but the Xbox Ally wins in resolution and refresh rate. That said, to get the best performance on Xbox Ally, you will often want to lock the resolution at 720p, so the Xbox Ally doesn't always take full advantage of its advantages. The Xbox Ally is arguably the most comfortable Windows gaming handheld on the market today. Asus opted for the PlayStation Portal approach by essentially splitting the Xbox Wireless Controller in half and connecting it to each side. Along with all of the buttons, triggers, and bumpers found on the Xbox Wireless Controller, the Xbox Ally has two remappable back buttons. It also has motion controls and HD haptics. One of the big selling points of the Xbox Ally is the custom, console-inspired dashboard that is easier to use than the traditional Windows interface. The Xbox Ally has a 512GB SSD, 16GB RAM, a microSD UHS-II card slot to expand storage capacity, two USB-C ports, and a headphone jack. Check out the Xbox Ally's specs and features below.

Specs: Processor: AMD Ryzen Z2 A RAM: 16GB LPDDR5X-6400 Storage: 512GB M.2 2280 SSD Display: 7\" IPS touchscreen (Gorilla Glass Victus) 1920 x 1080 120Hz refresh rate VRR supported AMD FreeSync Premium Controller Design: Contoured grips Hall Effect triggers Shoulder bumpers ABXY bumpers 2 remappable back buttons Analog sticks with light rings 6-Axis motion controls HD haptics 5 menu/settings buttons Ports: 2x USB 3.2 Type-C 3.5mm audio microSD: UHS-II reader (only UHS-II) Network: Wi-Fi 6E / Bluetooth 5.4 Battery: 80Wh Battery life: 1.5-5 hours Weight: 670g Dimensions: 290.8 x 121.5 x 50.7mm Get deal at Amazon See at Walmart See at Best Buy Game Pass Ultimate subscribers have a built-in library of hundreds of games for the Xbox Ally. Whether you already have a subscription or not, you'll want to purchase your membership from a major retailer instead of directly through Microsoft. The price of Game Pass Ultimate increased to $30/month in October, but major retailers still sell prepaid codes for $20/month. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

It's not the only Bethesda adaptation coming to Amazon's streaming service--a Wolfenstein show is coming as well--and some fans are hoping to see The Elder Scrolls game follow. Bethesda's Todd Howard--who has worked as a producer on Fallout and Elder Scrolls titles--won't rule out the possibility that it could happen. But don't expect an Elder Scrolls series anytime soon. While speaking with Eurogamer, Howard said that he \"can't rule in or rule out an Elder Scrolls thing in the future,\" before adding that he thought Fallout was more suitable as an adaptation because it had \"more to say in its genre.\" \"But you never know,\" added Howard. \"I think the impact of the show on Fallout as a franchise has been bigger than I expected, so it does make you think like, 'Hey, is there a path?'

    "description": "Battlefield 6's 1.1.3.0 update is bringing the fog of war into winter. As part of the new Winter Offensive, players will be able to access a new version of the Empire State map called Ice Lock Empire State. This map will only be around for a limited time, but it swaps out the standard map with frozen streets and other examples of cold and hazardous weather. The new map will also have a themed event mode, allowing you to play Domination, Conquest, and Gauntlet mission variations that utilize the new \"Freeze\" mechanic. Players will also be given access to the ice climbing axe through the Winter Offensive Bonus Path. Once they have the axe, players can unleash it as a melee weapon on unlucky foes. That bonus path also features an 11-tier, time-limited reward track featuring event cosmetics, and XP Boosters. According to Battlefield Labs, the new update has \"a broad range of fixes and refinements across Battlefield 6.\" Some of the improvements include weapon reliability, vehicle behavior, and quality-of-life bug fixes. You can find the complete notes for this update below. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
