    "title": "How Riftbound Fixes Magic: The Gathering's Biggest Problems",
    "description": "Riot Games recently launched Riftbound, a trading-card game based on the wildly popular League of Legends franchise. While the first thought that comes to mind when coming across a new TCG in an overcrowded market is usually “another one?” I’m here to tell you that not only does Riftbound have a strong foundation for a casual/competitive game, it actually improves and fixes many mechanics seen in other TCGs. Most notably, Riftbound addresses my biggest issues with Magic: The Gathering and its 30-year-old design that at times feels wildly outdated. Here’s a breakdown of just some of the many improvements I noticed while playing Riftbound as a seasoned Magic player. Casual Yet Competitive One of my least favorite aspects of Magic is having to juggle multiple decks for multiple situations. When playing Limited, I have to build a 40-card deck. When playing Pauper or Vintage, I have to maintain 60-card decks. When playing Commander with friends at the local brewery, I have to carry around a 100-card behemoth of a deck. The different formats all carry their own restrictions and decklists and it can be a lot to maintain for a single card game. This issue doesn’t exist for Riftbound, as any 40-card deck you buy or build is good for use in 1v1, 2v2, and three- or four-player Free-for-All. While any TCG can inspire the “grinding” mindset that comes with entering competitive play, I find myself regularly playing casual Riftbound matches simply because the game scales so well without deck modifications. It encourages the mindset of building a single deck and being able to play it in multiple formats, and means my Jinx deck that I’m so proud of can be shown off a lot more. To learn a bit more about this design choice of scalable formats, I talked with Nik Davidson, game design architect over at Riot Games. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

All PS Plus members will be able to claim five games starting December 2: Lego Horizon Adventures, Killing Floor 3, The Outlast Trials, Synduality Echo of Ada, and Neon White. If you haven't claimed November's PlayStation Plus free games yet, make sure to do so before next Tuesday, December 2. PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers can also get Skate Story as a day-one download through the Game Catalog, starting December 8. Lego Horizon Adventures is the headliner of this batch, as the Horizon spin-off game launched not too long ago. A lighthearted retelling of the events of Horizon Zero Dawn--but with a Lego spin--the game follows Aly on her quest to uncover the lost history of the world, following a cataclysm that saw machines rise to the top of the food chain. Killing Floor 3 is another recent release, and this multiplayer shooter sees teams of up to six players gear up to take down Zeds in stomach-churning combat. The Outlast Trials is also a grisly co-op game with terrifying elements woven into its design, as you'll need to complete grisly challenges to survive in this first-person psychological survival-horror game.

    "description": "Update: Valve has now commented on this unusual situation, saying it requested to play Horses in 2023 due to \"content in the store page.\" That led to it sharing feedback and a subsequent decision to prevent the game from releasing on Steam. In a statement shared with Game Developer, Valve explained that the step to play the game was not unprecedented. \"This happens sometimes if content on the store page causes concern that the game itself might not fall within our guidelines,\" a spokesperson said. \"After our team played through the build and reviewed the content, we gave the developer feedback about why we couldn't ship the game on Steam, consistent with our onboarding rules and guidelines. A short while later the developer asked us to reconsider the review, and our internal content review team discussed that extensively and communicated to the developer our final decision that we were not going to ship the game on Steam.\" There's no further explanation regarding why this situation played out as it did, or whether the developer did make adjustments based on Valve's request. The original story follows. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "A rare physical copy of Fortnite has sold at auction for $42,500. What made this copy so rare and valuable? The listing on the Heritage Auctions website said the sealed copy of the Xbox One version of the game with the Storm Master Weapon Pack was rated Wata 10 A++, and that's the highest grade possible. This physical version of the game, which was published by Gearbox, came out in 2017 before Fortnite blossomed to become the massively popular game it is today thanks to its battle royale mode. Some may recall that when Cliff Bleszinski revealed Fortnite to the world in 2011, it was a scavenging and survival game. Now, it's a cultural behemoth and the dominant player in the battle royale space with crossovers and collaborations galore, including numerous more to come in the new Chapter 7 update. The rare copy of Fortnite that was sold at auction on November 21 originally retailed for $60, so someone is probably making a nice return on this. Someone else on eBay is trying to sell a sealed copy of Fortnite on Xbox One for $7,000 right now. Another listing is asking $2,800. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Trainwiz‬ released the Really Useful Cliffracers mod on Nexus Mods, which swaps out the flying cliff racers with Thomas the Tank Engine. Trainwiz also left comments on the page that read like a direct challenge to Mattel. \"I made a mod that replaces cliffracers with Thomas the Tank Engine,\" wrote ‪Trainwiz‬. \"I am incapable of learning lessons whenever it involves corporations, because I fundamentally do not view toy company CEOs or media CEOs as people.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Now, the billionaire tech mogul has claimed that AI will become so ubiquitous that any disclosures about its use in game development are no longer required. Sweeney made the comment on X in a reply to motion capture designer Matt Workman. Workman said on November 13 that Steam and \"all digital marketplaces\" need to drop the \"Made with AI\" label, claiming it no longer matters. He went on to say that the label only exists because marketplaces \"sell to artists who put up a stink initially,\" though he believes that it \"looks ridiculous\" and isn't enforceable. Sweeney agreed with Workman, commenting on November 26 that the tag is only relevant to \"art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation.\" Otherwise, to Sweeney, AI disclosures \"make no sense,\" particularly when it comes to digital game stores like Steam, because \"AI will be involved in nearly all future production.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Microtransactions have become a standard part of video games, albeit one that is still heavily criticized to this day. Cosmetics and new DLC form the bulk of these quick purchases, which are typically introduced as optional preorder and post-launch content that complements a video game. One such game that sells cosmetics is Assassin's Creed Shadows, and associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois recently spoke about how these items have provided vital post-launch financial support. \"Microtransactions, for all the flak it gets, it allows us to do the Isu stuff, the quest stuff, the parkour updates, all of it,\" Lemay-Comtois said to IGN, arguing in favor for DLC. Assassin's Creed games don't operate in a vacuum when it comes to optional extras, as almost every AA and AAA released these days offers some form of additional content that you'll have to pay extra for. Call of Duty is notorious for its crossover skins, fighting games like Street Fighter 6 regularly release new characters to play as, and premium in-game currencies bought with real-world cash are very common. Assassin's Creed Shadows has received substantial free content since its launch earlier this year, and it recently received a major update. This added a new crossover with the hit anime series Attack on Titan, a new quest titled The Puzzlement, and Corrupted Castles will offer more variety, all for free. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
