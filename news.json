Amazon is selling mystery boxes with six Lego Spider-Man minifigures for $27 (was $30). The 10% discount only shaves three bucks from the price, but the Spider-Verse minifigures have largely been sold out at other retailers. At the moment, only Amazon and Target have Spider-Verse 6-Packs in stock--and you'll pay full price at Target. Single Spider-Verse minifigures are priced at $5, but every major retailer and the Lego Store are sold out of singles. Amazon has marked this as a Cyber Monday deal, so it may disappear at 12 AM PT (December 2). But unlike most of Amazon's Cyber Monday Lego deals, the store page doesn't have a countdown clock, so it could stick around after the sale ends. The Spider-Verse Lego minifigure collection includes 12 characters from the animated film series. Each minifigure comes with a stand and most also have an accessory. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Nvidia Shield TV Pro $170 (was $200) See at Amazon See at Best Buy If you're interested in cloud gaming and streaming, the Nvidia Shield TV Pro is arguably one of the best options available in 2025. It's a powerful little piece of hardware, letting you access GeForce Now along with all your favorite streaming platforms (like Netflix and Disney+). Normally a bit pricey at $200, Amazon and Best Buy are matching its lowest price ever of $170 for Cyber Monday--but since the sales end at 11:59 PM PT on December 1, you'll want to snag one soon before the limited-time offer disappears. Nvidia Shield TV Pro $170 (was $200) The Nvidia Shield TV Pro is an all-around streaming monster. This model includes the new Shield Remote, offering backlit buttons, a built-in microphone for voice commands, and even a lost remote locator feature (so you'll know exactly which cushion it slipped behind). The main attraction, however, is the box itself, which features some nice hardware. Here's a quick look at its specs: Nvidia Tegra X1+ processor (256-core GPU and 3GB RAM) 16GB storage (expandable) AI-upscaling for 4K 60fps Dolby Atmos support Dolby Vision support Gigabit Ethernet port HDMI 2.0 2x USB 3.0 Ports (Type A) Android 11 with Chromecast 4K built-in For gaming, you'll have access to Google Play Games and GeForce Now. That makes this a pretty cool central entertainment hub, offering you a chance to stream not just TV shows and movies, but also games. See at Amazon See at Best Buy If you like the concept of the Nvidia Shield TV Pro but want to save a few extra bucks, take a peek at its more affordable sibling--the standard Nvidia Shield TV. It comes with a similar Nvidia Tegra X1+ processor, though it's equipped with 2GB RAM instead of 3GB. You'll also lose out on the USB 3.0 ports and see a drop from 16GB of storage to just 8GB. However, at $125 (was $150), it might be a good choice for frugal shoppers. Another cloud gaming option is the Fire TV Stick 4K Max + Luna Controller Bundle, which is on sale for $70 (was $130) at Amazon. The Luna Controller is surprisingly great--especially when streaming with Luna--as it helps reduce input latency and is quite comfortable for extended gaming sessions. Note that these Fire TV Sticks all support Xbox Cloud Gaming. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Amazon has it listed for one of its best prices of the year right now, and since the customizable speaker also serves as an alarm clock and white noise machine, it's a fun purchase at $70 (was $90). Amazon's discount started on Black Friday and continues through Cyber Monday; however, the Cyber Monday event ends at 11:59 PM PT on December 1, so you have just a few more hours to cash in on this offer. Retro Pixel Art Bluetooth Speaker $70 (was $90) Available in five different styles (all of which are on sale), the Retro Pixel Art Bluetooth Speaker is quite popular with buyers. Sitting with nearly 11,000 reviews on Amazon, it's holding down an impressive 4.6 stars. Along with serving as a Bluetooth speaker, you can customize the pixel art on its display using the attached mini keypad. There's also a companion app where you can quickly adjust your settings--or download artwork from other users. So even if you're not the most artistic person on the planet, you can still get a fun design for the speaker. See at Amazon For playing music, you can connect via Bluetooth, USB, or microSD card. Beyond looking adorably retro and blasting tunes, the device also works as a white noise machine, a timer, and an alarm clock with 12 wake-up sounds. And since it gets around 8 hours of battery life on a charge, you can use it throughout your home before needing to plug in at night. Retro Pixel Art Bluetooth SpeakersThe same company responsible for the Retro Pixel Art Bluetooth Speaker also makes a few other cool speakers. A cheaper alternative is the Classic Gaming PC Style Speaker, which is just $56 (was $70). It's designed to look like (surprise!) a retro computer, though its display isn't designed for pixel art. Instead, you can use it as a digital picture frame. There's also the TimeBox Evo, which offers a similar pixel grid as that of the Retro Pixel Art Speaker, but it's housed inside a minimalist black frame. It's available for $38.20 (was $70).
