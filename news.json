Now, Trainwiz has struck again by placing Thomas in The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind, while hinting that he's been on the receiving end of Mattel's displeasure for his work. Trainwiz‬ released the Really Useful Cliffracers mod on Nexus Mods, which swaps out the flying cliff racers with Thomas the Tank Engine. Trainwiz also left comments on the page that read like a direct challenge to Mattel. \"I made a mod that replaces cliffracers with Thomas the Tank Engine,\" wrote ‪Trainwiz‬. \"I am incapable of learning lessons whenever it involves corporations, because I fundamentally do not view toy company CEOs or media CEOs as people.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Microtransactions have become a standard part of video games, albeit one that is still heavily criticized to this day. Cosmetics and new DLC form the bulk of these quick purchases, which are typically introduced as optional preorder and post-launch content that complements a video game. One such game that sells cosmetics is Assassin's Creed Shadows, and associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois recently spoke about how these items have provided vital post-launch financial support. \"Microtransactions, for all the flak it gets, it allows us to do the Isu stuff, the quest stuff, the parkour updates, all of it,\" Lemay-Comtois said to IGN, arguing in favor for DLC. Assassin's Creed games don't operate in a vacuum when it comes to optional extras, as almost every AA and AAA released these days offers some form of additional content that you'll have to pay extra for. Call of Duty is notorious for its crossover skins, fighting games like Street Fighter 6 regularly release new characters to play as, and premium in-game currencies bought with real-world cash are very common. Assassin's Creed Shadows has received substantial free content since its launch earlier this year, and it recently received a major update. This added a new crossover with the hit anime series Attack on Titan, a new quest titled The Puzzlement, and Corrupted Castles will offer more variety, all for free. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

It's time to check out these Black Friday deals on Apple Watches at Walmart. While multiple models are seeing discounts, one of the best budget-friendly options on sale right now is the Apple Watch SE second-generation line. You can buy a GPS-enabled 40mm version for $129 (was $279), a 44mm SE2 model for $159 (was $279), or grab the cellular version of both models for the same price. Apple Watch SE 40mm (Second Generation) $129 Not just useful for checking the time at the flick of a wrist, the Apple Watch SE2 is an affordable option for tracking your health and fitness. These are designed to seamlessly connect with your Apple devices, are water-resistant to 50 meters, and can be easily customized with a range of optional watch bands and watch faces sold separately. Anyone looking to track their activity can explore various metrics that the watch tracks, making this a solid option for first-time users.

    "description": "The Last of Us Seasons 1 and 2 on 4K Blu-ray Watch the hit show in 4K with these discounted Blu-rays See at Amazon HBO's The Last of Us TV series has been hailed as one of the best video game adaptations, and for Black Friday, you can get 4K Blu-rays of the show's two seasons at a new low price. Based on the critically acclaimed games developed by Naughty Dog, The Last of Us Season 1 is on sale for $16.49 (was $20), and Season 2 is available for $27.49 (was $40). A limited-edition steelbook version of this Blu-ray is also on sale for $35 (was $45). Check out both deals below, along with links to even more Last of Us deals available during Black Friday. The Last of Us Season 1 (4K Blu-ray) $16.49 (was $20) Season 1 of The Last of Us adapted the first game in the series for TV. Starring Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey, the HBO show follows the pair as they journey across the post-pandemic US, a country devastated by an outbreak of a lethal Cordyceps fungus. The first season ran for nine episodes, and each episode is accompanied by a short documentary detailing its production. Additional bonus materials include featurettes on how the video game was adapted for TV, profiles of the actors, and how the TV show connected to the video game source material. The Last of Us Season 1 Special Features: Inside the Episode (No. 1-9) Controllers Down: Adapting The Last of Us From Levels to Live Action The Last of Us: Stranger than Fiction Ashley Johnson Spotlight Get to Know Me: Actor profiles Is This a The Last of Us Line?

All seven episodes from Season 2 are included, along with special features including behind-the-scenes featurettes, deep dives into the characters, and interviews. These bonus materials all originally aired on HBO, but the Blu-ray does include two exclusive special features: Ellie's Ultimate Revenge explores Ellie's motivations throughout Season 2 and Beneath the Surface: The Visual FX of The Last of Us offers a closer look at how the world around the characters was created with props and grisly special effects. The Last of Us Season 2 Bonus Features: Ellie's Ultimate Revenge (New) Beneath the Surface: The Visual FX of The Last of Us (New) Growing the World of The Last of Us Welcome to Jackson set tour Joel's Journey to Season 2 Ellie's Journey to Season 2 Q&amp;A with Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey The Battle of Jackson, deconstructed Open Book: Isabela &amp; Young Mazino Mushroom Taste Test Character featurettes: Joel, Ellie, Abby, Dina \"Making of\" featurettes for episodes 1-7 See at Amazon The Last of Us Season 2 Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray) $35 (was $45) The steelbook edition contains the exact same special features, but the big draw here is the cover art of Joel and Ellie, flanked by Cordyceps virus iconography. See at Amazon HBO's The Last of Us series is a mostly faithful adaptation of the video games, and if you'd like to experience the source material, the PS5 remastered editions of both games are currently on sale during Black Friday. The Last of Us Part 1 is a remake of the original PS3 game and is now discounted to $30 (was $70). This version features substantially upgraded graphics and quality-of-life updates, as well as the Left Behind prequel chapter, new weapons, upgrades, visual filters, and a Speedrun Mode. The Last of Us Part 2 was already a good-looking game when it first debuted on PS4, but the PS5 version makes it look even better. The remastered version includes the original game and adds visual upgrades and levels featuring behind-the-scenes commentary from Naughty Dog developers. Additionally, you can explore three \"Lost Levels\" that weren't included in the game, test your skills in the roguelike survival mode No Return, and strum a few chords in Guitar Free Play mode.
