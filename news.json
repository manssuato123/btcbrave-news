Players can get all of the different types of ore in The Forge using your various pickaxes, and some of The Forge codes that are kicking around may be able to help with that. That said, with dozens of ores available in the highly popular Roblox experience, it can be quite confusing where to find all of them.

Now, developer Battlestate Games has revealed that the game has sold over 1 million copies in the month following release. Unlike some early access titles, participating in Escape from Tarkov's beta required a purchase of one of the game's various pre-order editions, so the post-release sales will mostly represent newcomers to the game. Battlestate Games controversially required that players re-purchase the game if they wanted to play it on Steam, even if they already purchased it directly from Battlestate. Escape from Tarkov also saw some controversy around its sales strategy when the studio revealed a $250 pre-order edition that unlocked access to an exclusive PVE mode, and other features that players called out as pay-to-win.

    "description": "Crystal Dynamics announced Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis last week at The Game Awards, calling it a reimagining of the original 1996 Tomb Raider. While the studio wants to stay faithful to the original, it has also said it plans to tone down the brutal difficulty of the nearly 30-year-old PlayStation 1 game. Speaking in a press conference, as reported by GamesRadar, Crystal Dynamics developer Will Kerslake was asked about adapting the original PS1 game specifically when it comes to difficulty. Like many games of its era, the 1996 game was known to have its punishingly difficult sections, including insta-kill death traps that were often near-impossible to avoid without the benefit of hindsight. \"Part of reimagining a game right is adjusting that game evolving for modern player tastes,\" Kerslake said, and though he doesn't explicitly mention difficulty it seems safe to say that Legacy of Atlantis will have far fewer insta-kills. That doesn't mean the game will be a walk in the park, however. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "ROG Xbox Ally Gaming Handheld Is On Sale For Only $489 For A Limited Time",
    "description": "Asus ROG Xbox Ally Gaming Handheld $489 (was $600) Get deal at Amazon See at Walmart See at Best Buy See at Target Asus ROG Xbox Ally 2-in-1 Premium Case (Official) $70 See at Amazon See at Best Buy There's still time to save big on the first official Xbox gaming handheld. The Asus ROG Xbox Ally, which launched in October with a $600 MSRP, is on sale for $489 at Amazon and Walmart, $490 at Best Buy, and $520 at Target. It's still not entirely clear when this deal ends, but it's still available as of December 17. The $489 price at Amazon is an all-time low for the recently released Windows gaming handheld. Amazon has also restocked the official Xbox Ally 2-in-1 Premium Case. If you pick up the Xbox Ally at Amazon, you should also check out some of the third-party accessories available now, including docking stations, screen protectors, travel cases, and microSD UHS-II cards. Though it's sold out more often than not at Amazon, the official Xbox Ally 2-in-1 Premium Case is currently available to order. Asus ROG Xbox Ally Gaming Handheld $489 (was $600) The ROG Xbox Ally is an entry-level Windows gaming handheld with impressive features and performance for the price. The Ryzen Z2 A chip is comparable to Steam Deck's custom AMD APU, and if you increase the TDP--at the expense of battery life--the Xbox Ally can outperform the Steam Deck OLED. For reference, the Steam Deck OLED 512GB model retails for $549. The Xbox Ally has a 1920 x 1080p IPS display with 120Hz refresh rate and support for VRR and AMD FreeSync Premium. If you're comparing to the Steam Deck OLED, Valve's handheld has a 7.4-inch 1280 x 800p OLED display with HDR and 90Hz refresh rate. So the Steam Deck wins in panel type and size, but the Xbox Ally wins in resolution and refresh rate. That said, to get the best performance on Xbox Ally, you will often want to lock the resolution at 720p, so the Xbox Ally doesn't always take full advantage of its advantages. The Xbox Ally is arguably the most comfortable Windows gaming handheld on the market today. Asus opted for the PlayStation Portal approach by essentially splitting the Xbox Wireless Controller in half and connecting it to each side. Along with all of the buttons, triggers, and bumpers found on the Xbox Wireless Controller, the Xbox Ally has two remappable back buttons. It also has motion controls and HD haptics. One of the big selling points of the Xbox Ally is the custom, console-inspired dashboard that is easier to use than the traditional Windows interface. The Xbox Ally has a 512GB SSD, 16GB RAM, a microSD UHS-II card slot to expand storage capacity, two USB-C ports, and a headphone jack. Check out the Xbox Ally's specs and features below. If you want to read more about the Xbox Ally and the higher-powered $1,000 Xbox Ally X, check out our buying guide and our review of the Ally X. Specs: Processor: AMD Ryzen Z2 A RAM: 16GB LPDDR5X-6400 Storage: 512GB M.2 2280 SSD Display: 7\" IPS touchscreen (Gorilla Glass Victus) 1920 x 1080 120Hz refresh rate VRR supported AMD FreeSync Premium Controller Design: Contoured grips Hall Effect triggers Shoulder bumpers ABXY bumpers 2 remappable back buttons Analog sticks with light rings 6-Axis motion controls HD haptics 5 menu/settings buttons Ports: 2x USB 3.2 Type-C 3.5mm audio microSD: UHS-II reader (only UHS-II) Network: Wi-Fi 6E / Bluetooth 5.4 Battery: 80Wh Battery life: 1.5-5 hours Weight: 670g Dimensions: 290.8 x 121.5 x 50.7mm Get deal at Amazon See at Walmart See at Best Buy Game Pass Ultimate subscribers have a built-in library of hundreds of games for the Xbox Ally. Whether you already have a subscription or not, you'll want to purchase your membership from a major retailer instead of directly through Microsoft. The price of Game Pass Ultimate increased to $30/month in October, but major retailers still sell prepaid codes for $20/month. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

That was apparently enough to save the studio from financial ruin, but perhaps not enough to pay for production a second game. According to a statement released by the developers, Horses generated $65,000 in net revenue, which allowed Santa Ragione to repay its loans and pay the royalties it owed to Andrea Lucco Borlera, the author and creator of Horses. However, the income won't allow the team to immediately begin working on another game. \"This result is not enough to begin production on a new game,\" reads the statement. \"The money primarily covers obligations created by a prolonged end of development. If sales remain steady, we may be able to fund a new prototype in the future, but the team has had to, and will continue to, take other jobs and projects in the meantime. Reuniting everyone will not be easy, even if it is something we would love.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "If you've been looking for more of a challenge from Dying Light: The Beast, then you're about to get it. Developer Techland has dropped Update 1.5 for Dying Light: The Beast, and it's giving players the chance to test their skills in the Nightmare Experience. To turn up the heat on players, human and infected enemies are now smarter, more aggressive, significantly stronger, and more reactive to the players' actions. Volatiles may now even appear during the day in some of the Dark Zones, and players have far fewer resources to deal with them all. If that wasn't enough, there's a new super enemy, the Alpha Volatile. Techland calls it \"the most intelligent Volatile in the history of Dying Light.\" It's even smarter than the traditional Volatiles and its heightened senses can track the player across the entire map unless they reach a safe zone. The Alpha Volatiles can be killed, but good luck trying to pull that off. At night, the player is the prey for this creature. Players can also get new finishing maneuvers, including one-handed blunt weapons and one-handed slashing weapons. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
