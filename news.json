It arrives alongside the new Grand Theft Auto 5 Title Update 1.72, the full patch notes for which you can see below.

But all of the mansions come with a fast-travel ability that lets players go from the lap of luxury to any of their other properties in the city without the hassle of driving. Players can take remote work to the next level by using a master control terminal to remotely manage their businesses. But when the need for travel arises, there's a 20-car garage with ample space for personal vehicles as well as a private rooftop helipad that comes with a Volatus helicopter.

The patch notes for the December 10 update detail various bug fixes and improvements across all modes, but some of the changes are a disappointment for Zombies players. A few bugs are squashed for Season 1's new Astra Malorum Zombies map. The patch notes address an issue where Oscar could become stuck in the starting area, and it also fixes the map's new LGM-1 Wonder Weapon, which could sometimes fire with unintended behavior when paired with certain GobbleGums and the Frenzied Fire augment. Unfortunately, this also affects a strategy players were using to help make the Wonder Weapon more powerful during the tough boss fight for Astra Malorum. The update also corrects an issue that previously awarded players the completion rewards for the Astra Malorum boss fight even when the encounter was actually failed. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Astro Bot Physical Edition $40 (was $60) See at Amazon See at PS Direct See at Walmart See at Best Buy See at Target Astro Bot is on sale for its lowest price ever during PlayStation's 2025 Holiday Sale. The wonderful PS5-exclusive 3D platformer normally sells for $60 and rarely receives discounts, but you can grab a copy for only $40 through December 18. This deal kicked off last month alongside the rest of the Black Friday PlayStation hardware and game deals. Amazon sold out of copies within days, but the deal is back in stock as of December 10. The Astro Bot discount is also available at PlayStation Direct, Walmart, Target, and Best Buy. Unfortunately, the Astro Bot Joyful DualSense Controller deal remains sold out at all retailers. You can, however, save $20 on other limited-edition models, including the Walmart-exclusive Icon Blue DualSense. Astro Bot Physical Edition $40 (was $60) Astro Bot is a 3D platformer starring Team Asobi's plucky, titular robot hero as he embarks on a galaxy-spanning quest to save his comrades from an evil alien. The superb adventure builds off of the foundation of Astro's Playroom, the free pack-in game that launched with the PS5 console to showcase the DualSense Controller's unique features. Over the course of 90-plus levels, Astro Bot makes brilliant use of the DualSense's adaptive triggers, haptic feedback, touch panel, gyro controls, and built-in speaker. From a mechanical perspective, Astro Bot is arguably the most inventive and playful 3D platformer ever made. Astro Bot also doubles as a celebration of all things PlayStation. You'll meet little robots themed around other PlayStation heroes and heroines, including Ratchet, Rivet, Kratos, Atreus, Aloy, Nathan Drake, Sly Cooper, Jak, Crash Bandicoot, and many more. Some of the levels are even themed around different franchises and implement mechanics from those games. Astro Bot earned a 9/10 in GameSpot's review and won GOTY at last year's Game Awards. See at Amazon See at PS Direct See at Walmart DualSense Controller Black Friday Deals Save $20 on all colors. See at Amazon PlayStation Holiday 2025 Game Deals PlayStation's Holiday Sale features a bunch of other notable game deals, including Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart for $30, Death Stranding 2 for $50, God of War: Ragnarok for only $20, and Marvel's Spider-Man 2 for $30. A bunch of the games in the list below are sold out at Amazon, so we've updated those links to lead to Walmart or PlayStation Direct. It's worth noting that PlayStation Direct offers free standard shipping on all orders. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The Game Awards are just around the corner, and while this time of year is surely exciting for all the nominees--and those of us eager for new game announcements--this year, there is one studio in particular that has more reason than any to celebrate: Sandfall Interactive. Earlier this year, the small-scale studio took the world by storm with its debut title, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Despite being Sandfall's first game, the narrative-driven, turn-based RPG quickly entered the pantheon of all-time greatest RPGs, earning nearly universal critical acclaim for its artistry, story, and espousal of mechanics and themes typically associated with Japanese RPGs. Now, Sandfall Interactive stands poised to make The Game Awards history. Last month, the studio broke The Game Awards' record for most award nominations, earning a whopping 13, including Game of the Year. Earlier this year, I spoke with the studio's creative director, Guillaume Broche, who said the team was in \"disbelief\" about how the game has been received; it stands to reason that this sentiment has only grown with the game's tremendous success.

Starting with The Ghoul (Walton Goggins), this holiday special features Dogmeat and shows a human arm--\"specifically, a fat man's\"--burning in a fireplace for roughly an hour and a half. On YouTube, Prime Video released the officially titled Fallout: The Ghoul Log, which can be seen below. The Ghoul makes a couple of revelations about the wasteland early on. First up, he says, \"Well, this ain't no Whoville,\" implying The Grinch is part of that universe. Funnily enough, Goggins portrays The Grinch in a Walmart ad campaign this holiday season. And sadly, The Ghoul notes that Santa Claus doesn't exist in the wasteland. Regardless, the video can help fill in the time until Fallout Season 2 premieres next week on December 18. Prime Video will drop episodes weekly through February--a major shift for Fallout. The first season saw all episodes arrive at once on the streaming platform. Speaking of that, you can watch Season 1 for free on Samsung TV Plus Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Now, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Keir Starmer, and a member of Parliament, are keeping up the pressure on Rockstar. \"It's a deeply concerning case,\" said Starmer. \"Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we're determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union. Our ministers will look into the particular case the member raises and will keep him updated.\" The case was brought up by Edinburgh East and Musselburgh MP, Chris Murray, who met with Rockstar on behalf of the workers. Murray noted that Rockstar initially refused to meet with him unless an NDA was signed, but the company relented following his refusal. Murray also stated that he was unconvinced by Rockstar's account of the firings. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
