With the company having launched its own mobile store, it has also started a second free games program on iOS and Android devices, kicking things off with a curated library of titles and weekly freebies. The app also features mobile versions of Fortnite, Fall Guys, and Rocket League Sideswipe. To access these games you will need to create a free Epic account and install the free Epic Games Store mobile app and log in with your account, but once you do, you can start claiming your free games every Thursday through it. One other thing to note is that Android users can access the app via Android-based emulation devices like Retroid Pocket, as they aren't limited to just smartphone and tablets. Download the Epic Games Store Mobile app For now, only iOS users in the European Union can install the app, but the app is available worldwide to Android device users and they have a wider selection of games to choose from in comparison. Like its PC counterpart, you'll have one week to grab each game that's offered. Here's a closer look at what you can grab this week, and what the current mobile games library has to offer. You can also explore what the free PC games are this week on the Epic Games Store. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Borderlands 4 is on sale for only $35 just two months after its release. The 50% discount is for the physical edition on PS5 and Xbox Series X. This deal first popped up today (November 27) at GameStop, and Amazon matched it shortly after. Amazon has sold out of the PS5 edition once already, so this deal might not be available after today. Borderlands 4 for PS5 / Xbox Series X $35 (was $70) While previous Borderlands games were primarily set on the planet of Pandora--Borderlands 3 expanded on this with several more planets to visit--Borderlands 4 takes place on the world of Kairos, giving players free rein to cause some chaos as they take on the forces of the Timekeeper. Just like its predecessors, the key goal here is to take control of one of four unique Vault Hunters, grow their skills, and strengthen them further by finding powerful weapons and gear. It's a formula that has been present since the original Borderlands game, but in Borderlands 4, that gameplay has been fine-tuned to its best and enhanced with quality-of-life features. PS5 -- $35 ($70) Xbox Series X -- $35 ($70) See at Amazon See at GameStop Borderlands 4 for Nintendo Switch 2 $55 (was $70) | Release Date TBA The Nintendo Switch 2 port of Borderlands 4 was originally slated for October 3, just a few weeks after the game's September 1 launch on other platforms. But then about a week before launch day, Gearbox announced an indefinite delay to polish the experience on Switch 2. If you're planning on buying Borderlands 4 for Nintendo Switch 2, it makes sense to secure a preorder right now. Target has slashed $15 from the price. Amazon was matching this offer but sold out fast. Keep in mind this is a Game-Key Card, so you will need to download Borderlands 4 from the eShop after loading the cartridge into your console for the first time.

    "description": "Dragon Ball Super: Complete Series Steelbook Box Set (Blu-ray) $120 (was $200) See at Amazon Dragon Ball fans can save big on an awesome Blu-ray box set during Amazon's Black Friday sale. Dragon Ball Super: The Complete Series is discounted to only $120 (was $200) through November 28, or until it sells out. This Collector's Edition Blu-ray set comes with 10 steelbook cases and a decorative metal display box. Amazon's Black Friday deal matches the all-time low price from February and last holiday season. Recently, the Collector's Edition has hovered around $150, but Amazon has priced it as high as $260 this year (and more than once). Take a closer look at Dragon Ball Super's Complete Series below. At the bottom of this article we included a list of DBZ movies and box sets featured in Amazon's Buy Two, Get One Free Blu-ray promotion, including the new Dragon Ball Super: Broly Steelbook Edition. Dragon Ball Super: Complete Series Steelbook Box Set (Blu-ray) $120 (was $200) The entire Dragon Ball Super arc is collected across 20 discs, two in each steelbook case. That's right, this gift set comes with 10 steelbooks and a premium metal display case. The box has dedicated slots for each steelbook and a lid featuring the dragon Shenron. At the $120 deal price, you're paying $12 per steelbook, which is quite cheap compared to standalone anime Blu-rays with steelbook cases. The total runtime for the 131 episodes is 54 hours and 35 minutes. The English dub has Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround Sound. If you want to watch the series in Japanese with English subtitles, the audio is Dolby TrueHD 2.0 audio. The even number discs in the box set have multiple textless opening/closing songs as well as interviews, expo panels, and other featurettes as bonus features. Dragon Ball Super takes place during a 10-year period following the Majin Buu arc in Dragon Ball Z.

    "title": "Lego Star Wars Executor And Tantive IV Starships Are $40 Each For Black Friday",
    "description": "Lego Star Wars Executor Super Star Destroyer (630 Pieces) $40 (was $70) See at Walmart Lego Star Wars Tantive IV (654 Pieces) $40 (was $80) | Retiring soon See at Amazon See at Walmart Lego Star Wars Boarding the Tantive IV (502 Pieces) $33 (was $55) | Retiring soon See at Amazon See at Walmart Walmart's Black Friday Lego deals are selling fast, but Star Wars fans can still add Darth Vader and Princess Leia's ships to their collections at steeply discounted prices. The 630-piece Executor Super Star Destroyer is $30 off, dropping the price to only $40 (was $70). The Tantive IV is also on sale for $40, but this 654-piece model retails for $80, so you're saving 50% on Princess Leia's ship from A New Hope. Amazon is matching Walmart's deal for the Tantive IV. Star Wars fans can also save big on Boarding the Tantive IV, a 502-piece Lego set piece that recreates Darth Vader's first appearance. At the time of writing, Walmart has Boarding the Tantive IV for $33 (was $55), and Amazon is selling it for $38.49. Amazon had the $33 price earlier today (November 26), so it's possible the retailer will lower it again. The alternative is Walmart could raise its price, so we'd recommend scooping up the $33 deal while you still can. Lego Star Wars Executor Super Star Destroyer (630 Pieces) $40 (was $70) The Executor Super Star Destroyer launched in 2023 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. Although it used to be sold at other retailers, it has been exclusive to Walmart and the Lego Store for a while now. Darth Vader's starship looks incredible as a Lego model. For a 630-piece set, it has an impressive level of detail and offers a varied build process featuring a lot of tiny pieces. The greebling on the top of the Executor is reminiscent of some Ultimate Collector Series starships. The completed build measures 17 x 7 x 5.5 inches, so you'll want to clear some shelf space before you assemble the Imperial flagship. The model has two detachable miniature Star Destroyers with translucent pieces. These were included to illustrate the enormity of Vader's ship. The Executor comes with a display stand, name placard, and the Return of the Jedi 40th Anniversary Lego brick. Fittingly, the commemorative logo features Darth Vader. The Executor comes with an instruction booklet, but you can also use the Lego Builder app's 3D interactive walkthrough of each step. See at Walmart Lego Star Wars Tantive IV (654 Pieces) $40 (was $80) | Retiring soon It's fitting that the other Lego Star Wars ship that's on sale for $40 is the Tantive IV. Star Wars: A New Hope opens with the Princess Leia's CR90 corvette fleeing an Imperial Star Destroyer. Lego's 654-piece model of the Tantive IV measures 12.5 x 4 x 6 inches. Like the Executor, the Tantive IV has a lot of small pieces, especially for the 11 engines and turbolasers. It comes with a black display stand and nameplate as well as a commemorative brick. The Tantive IV's special Lego brick is emblazoned with the Lego Star Wars 25th Anniversary logo featuring R2-D2. Lego is retiring the Tantive IV soon, so there's no guarantee it will be restocked after Walmart and Amazon sell out. See at Amazon See at Walmart Lego Star Wars Boarding the Tantive IV (502 Pieces) $33 (was $55) | Retiring soon The 502-piece Boarding the Tantive IV launched the same day as the starship display model and is retiring alongside it, too. The set piece continues the opening scene from A New Hope, which gave viewers their first look at Darth Vader. The entryway of the Tantive IV measures 8.5 x 5 x 3 inches and features multiple interactive components. You can push levers to open the door for the Darth Vader and shift the floorboards to knock Stormtroopers off their feet. Boarding the Tantive IV comes with seven Lego Star Wars minifigures: Darth Vader 2 Stormtroopers 2 Rebel Fleet Troopers Captain Antilles Clone Trooper Fives (25th Anniversary) Clone Trooper Fives, a character from the animated Clone Wars series, is a bonus minifigure that can be displayed on his own 25th Anniversary stand. See at Amazon See at Walmart Walmart's Black Friday sale kicked off November 25 with deals on three Star Wars UCS models. Two of the deals are sold out, but you can still save $30 on Jango Fett's Firespray-Class Starship. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Fans of the Blue Bomber can pick up the '90s animated series on Blu-ray for only $30 (was $50). Mega Man: The Complete Series just launched on Blu-ray at the end of October, so it's not surprising this is a new all-time low for one of Discotek Media's latest Blu-ray releases. Several other adaptations of video games in Discotek Media's catalog are on sale for Black Friday, including Street Fighter: The Animated Series for $32.59 (was $40), Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva for $15 (was $25), Monster Rancher: The Complete Series for $36 (was $60), and Darkstalkers: The Complete Animated Series for $24 (was $40). Darkstalkers launched last month on the same day as Mega Man. You can also save big on several of Discotek's Digimon movie and TV collections. Mega Man: The Complete Series (Blu-ray) $30 (was $50) | Black Friday Deal Mega Man: The Complete Series includes all 27 episodes from the show's two-season run (1994-96). It's worth emphasizing that while this is a Blu-ray disc, the series is presented in standard definition with the original broadcast aspect ratio of 4:3. Bonus materials include an interesting mix of archival content, TV commercials, and new features like select commentary tracks from Mega Man's US voice actor, Ian James Corlett. The total runtime for the series on Blu-ray is 10 hours and 50 minutes. Prior to the Blu-ray's release, the only way to get the series in physical format was to buy the out-of-print 2014 DVD from a reseller. See at Amazon See at Crunchyroll Mega Man: The Complete Series Blu-ray Special Features Mega Man original pilot pitch Scans of the original press kit TV commercial Toy commercial Art galleries Series bible All-new commentary from Mega Man voice actor Ian James Corlett Like other animated series of the time, Mega Man is a lighthearted cartoon with plenty of silliness. Even though it's a family-friendly show, it still has plenty of action, and the show accurately recreates the main plot of games from the time. Mega Man regularly battles Dr. Wily's mechanized forces, and episodes regularly introduce new Robot Masters. This show was a joint effort between Ruby-Spears Productions and Ashi Productions, and while the episodes are still presented in standard definition, they still look great, as the slick animation style has held up well.

    "description": "Minecraft Physical Edition (PS5) $25 (was $30) See at Amazon Amazon's Black Friday deals are officially here, and right now you'll find the Minecraft Physical Edition on PS5 for its lowest price ever. It's discounted to just $25 (was $30), so if you haven't yet played the iconic game, this is a great chance to dive in (or snag it as an affordable gift for a friend or family member). The discount doesn't seem like much, but it comes bundled with 3,500 Tokens, which typically cost $20. This version of Minecraft doesn't see many discounts. It briefly dropped its price by a few bucks during the summer, but this Black Friday deal is the best we've seen. If you're looking for a holiday gift for a younger gamer in your life, this is likely a good choice--just keep in mind this discount only applies to the physical PS5 version. Minecraft Physical Edition (PS5) $25 (was $30) While you'll find Minecraft for $20 at most digital storefronts, this physical edition deal is actually the better offer. Not only do you get a few in-game goodies, but you're getting an additional value of $20 from the 3,500 Tokens. That's a total value of $40 for just $25--and if you know you'll be buying stuff from the in-game store, this is certainly the edition to get. It gets you a physical copy of Minecraft, 3,500 Tokens, and two in-game items: the Popcorn Bucket Hat and Butter Shirt. See at Amazon Minecraft has seen massive success over the years, so it should come as no surprise that it's built up an impressive list of accompanying merchandise.

These include the 555-piece Ghast Balloon village Attack set, which is down to $56 (was $70), while the Woodland Mansion Fighting Ring is discounted to $41.49 (was $50), and the Trial Chamber is on sale for $32 (was $40).
