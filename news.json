During CD Projekt Red's latest earnings briefing, Joint CEO Michał Nowakowski said there are \"meaningful\" and \"real\" benefits to using the technology. The company is already implementing such technologies \"mainly in the productivity areas\" and so far that's where the \"largest benefits\" have stemmed from, he explained, as reported by GamesRadar. A developer won't be able to use AI to make an entire game, though, and humans will remain essential to the process, he said. \"The benefits are real, they’re meaningful; but it's not a situation--and I'm unaware of such a situation--where AI could 'sit down and make games.' That's our take. It doesn't mean it's not gonna be useful, but it's not gonna be making The Witcher 5, or 6, or anything like that,\" Nowakowski explained. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

If you're a fan of traditional turn-based RPGs made by Square Enix, we'd highly recommend checking it out--especially now that it has received its first discount. Amazon Prime members can get Bravely Default HD Remaster for $30 (was $40). This is a limited-time Lightning Deal. Bravely Default originally released on Nintendo 3DS in Japan in 2012. An expanded version of Flying Fairy arrived in North America in 2014, so the Switch 2 edition is technically the third iteration of the thoroughly nostalgic turn-based RPG. Bravely Default is one of the best games from the Nintendo 3DS era, and the remaster is great for newcomers and returning players alike. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

At The Game Awards, the game's first villain--the pirate king Bawma--was revealed, along with confirmation that actor and musician Lenny Kravitz will assume the role. Earlier in the year, IO confirmed that one of Bond's trusted associates, Dr. Selina Tan, will be portrayed by English actress Gemma Chan. GameSpot sat down with 007: First Light narrative director Martin Emborg to talk about the star power fueling his game, the potential pitfalls of revealing too much info too soon, and a little bit more about where Bond will run into Bawma during this adventure.

Innocent enough, but in the typical Grinch way, he turned sour on the game, saying it got boring and needed him to be in it. \"I used to, but then it got boring. Very boring.

    "title": "Arcade1Up's Fast &amp; The Furious Cabinet On Sale For Its Lowest Price",
    "description": "Arcade1Up The Fast &amp; The Furious Deluxe Arcade Cabinet $500 (was $600) See at Amazon If you’re looking to start the New Year with a refreshed game room, take a peek at Amazon’s current offer for Arcade1Up’s The Fast &amp; The Furious Deluxe Arcade. The retailer is slashing prices on a long list of arcade cabinets, but few are seeing the full $100 discount of The Fast &amp; The Furious Deluxe--which is currently listed for its best price of the year. But since the arcade cabinet was sold out the other week, we can’t imagine this offer will stick around for long. Arcade1Up The Fast &amp; The Furious Deluxe Arcade Cabinet $500 (was $600) Arcade1Up The Fast &amp; The Furious Deluxe Arcade Cabinet features two arcade games: The Fast &amp; The Furious and The Fast &amp; The Furious: Drift. Four machines can be linked via your local network for competitive play, and there’s an online leaderboard for you to track your performance. The cabinet stands over 64 inches tall and weighs nearly 70lbs. It sports a 17-inch LCD display, integrated speakers, and colorful artwork from the game. The control panel features a steering wheel rather than a set of buttons. At the bottom of the cabinet are gas and brake pedals and a molded faux coin door. See at Amazon The Fast &amp; The Furious Deluxe Cabinet is part of a larger Arcade1Up sales event, which is one of the best we’ve seen this year. Three Deluxe Cabinets are on sale, with the NBA Jam model also seeing a $100 price cut. For something smaller, the Ms. Pac-Man / Galaga Countercade is $130 (was $150), and it’s the ideal size for a countertop or table. The Mortal Kombat II Classic Special Edition is also getting its first price cut. These deals come after the company announced it was closing last week, only to be acquired by toy manufacturer Basic Fun--so it looks like the cabinet brand is, thankfully, sticking around for now. Check out more Arcade1Up deals below.

See at Amazon For more chaotic racing action, take a look at Fast &amp; Furious: Arcade Edition. Launched in October, it’s now available for $20 (was $30). The deal applies to the Switch and PS5 versions, both of which let you cruise around in eight iconic cars from the movies--such as a Dodge Charger, Corvette Z06, and Shelby GT500 KR. Local multiplayer is also supported--so if you'd rather not buy two Arcade1Up cabinets and link them together, this is a much cheaper way to get your competitive fix. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
