    "description": "Lego Star Wars Executor Super Star Destroyer (630 Pieces) $40 (was $70) See at Walmart Lego Star Wars Tantive IV (654 Pieces) $40 (was $80) | Retiring soon See at Amazon See at Walmart Lego Star Wars Boarding the Tantive IV (502 Pieces) $33 (was $55) | Retiring soon See at Amazon See at Walmart Walmart's Black Friday Lego deals are selling fast, but Star Wars fans can still add Darth Vader and Princess Leia's ships to their collections at steeply discounted prices. The 630-piece Executor Super Star Destroyer is $30 off, dropping the price to only $40 (was $70). The Tantive IV is also on sale for $40, but this 654-piece model retails for $80, so you're saving 50% on Princess Leia's ship from A New Hope. Amazon is matching Walmart's deal for the Tantive IV. Star Wars fans can also save big on Boarding the Tantive IV, a 502-piece Lego set piece that recreates Darth Vader's first appearance. At the time of writing, Walmart has Boarding the Tantive IV for $33 (was $55), and Amazon is selling it for $38.49. Amazon had the $33 price earlier today (November 26), so it's possible the retailer will lower it again. The alternative is Walmart could raise its price, so we'd recommend scooping up the $33 deal while you still can. Lego Star Wars Executor Super Star Destroyer (630 Pieces) $40 (was $70) The Executor Super Star Destroyer launched in 2023 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. Although it used to be sold at other retailers, it has been exclusive to Walmart and the Lego Store for a while now. Darth Vader's starship looks incredible as a Lego model. For a 630-piece set, it has an impressive level of detail and offers a varied build process featuring a lot of tiny pieces. The greebling on the top of the Executor is reminiscent of some Ultimate Collector Series starships. The completed build measures 17 x 7 x 5.5 inches, so you'll want to clear some shelf space before you assemble the Imperial flagship. The model has two detachable miniature Star Destroyers with translucent pieces. These were included to illustrate the enormity of Vader's ship. The Executor comes with a display stand, name placard, and the Return of the Jedi 40th Anniversary Lego brick. Fittingly, the commemorative logo features Darth Vader. The Executor comes with an instruction booklet, but you can also use the Lego Builder app's 3D interactive walkthrough of each step. See at Walmart Lego Star Wars Tantive IV (654 Pieces) $40 (was $80) | Retiring soon It's fitting that the other Lego Star Wars ship that's on sale for $40 is the Tantive IV. Star Wars: A New Hope opens with the Princess Leia's CR90 corvette fleeing an Imperial Star Destroyer. Lego's 654-piece model of the Tantive IV measures 12.5 x 4 x 6 inches. Like the Executor, the Tantive IV has a lot of small pieces, especially for the 11 engines and turbolasers. It comes with a black display stand and nameplate as well as a commemorative brick. The Tantive IV's special Lego brick is emblazoned with the Lego Star Wars 25th Anniversary logo featuring R2-D2. Lego is retiring the Tantive IV soon, so there's no guarantee it will be restocked after Walmart and Amazon sell out. See at Amazon See at Walmart Lego Star Wars Boarding the Tantive IV (502 Pieces) $33 (was $55) | Retiring soon The 502-piece Boarding the Tantive IV launched the same day as the starship display model and is retiring alongside it, too. The set piece continues the opening scene from A New Hope, which gave viewers their first look at Darth Vader. The entryway of the Tantive IV measures 8.5 x 5 x 3 inches and features multiple interactive components. You can push levers to open the door for the Darth Vader and shift the floorboards to knock Stormtroopers off their feet. Boarding the Tantive IV comes with seven Lego Star Wars minifigures: Darth Vader 2 Stormtroopers 2 Rebel Fleet Troopers Captain Antilles Clone Trooper Fives (25th Anniversary) Clone Trooper Fives, a character from the animated Clone Wars series, is a bonus minifigure that can be displayed on his own 25th Anniversary stand. See at Amazon See at Walmart Walmart's Black Friday sale kicked off November 25 with deals on three Star Wars UCS models. Two of the deals are sold out, but you can still save $30 on Jango Fett's Firespray-Class Starship. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Minecraft Physical Edition (PS5) $25 (was $30) See at Amazon Amazon's Black Friday deals are officially here, and right now you'll find the Minecraft Physical Edition on PS5 for its lowest price ever. It's discounted to just $25 (was $30), so if you haven't yet played the iconic game, this is a great chance to dive in (or snag it as an affordable gift for a friend or family member). The discount doesn't seem like much, but it comes bundled with 3,500 Tokens, which typically cost $20. This version of Minecraft doesn't see many discounts. It briefly dropped its price by a few bucks during the summer, but this Black Friday deal is the best we've seen. If you're looking for a holiday gift for a younger gamer in your life, this is likely a good choice--just keep in mind this discount only applies to the physical PS5 version. Minecraft Physical Edition (PS5) $25 (was $30) While you'll find Minecraft for $20 at most digital storefronts, this physical edition deal is actually the better offer. Not only do you get a few in-game goodies, but you're getting an additional value of $20 from the 3,500 Tokens. That's a total value of $40 for just $25--and if you know you'll be buying stuff from the in-game store, this is certainly the edition to get. It gets you a physical copy of Minecraft, 3,500 Tokens, and two in-game items: the Popcorn Bucket Hat and Butter Shirt. See at Amazon Minecraft has seen massive success over the years, so it should come as no surprise that it's built up an impressive list of accompanying merchandise. And ahead of Black Friday, several Lego Minecraft sets are on sale. These include the 555-piece Ghast Balloon village Attack set, which is down to $56 (was $70), while the Woodland Mansion Fighting Ring is discounted to $41.49 (was $50), and the Trial Chamber is on sale for $32 (was $40).

    "title": "Arc Raiders Is Discounted On PC Until December 1",
    "description": "Arc Raiders $34.39 (was $40) See at Fanatical (Standard) See at Fanatical (Deluxe) We've seen a bunch of highly anticipated shooters hit the market over the past few months, and while Battlefield 6 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 might be the heavy hitters, extraction shooter Arc Raiders is earning just as much praise. It's currently one of the best-selling and most played games on Steam--and ahead of Black Friday, you can add it to your collection for just $34.39 (was $40). The deal is part of Fanatical's Black Friday sale, which runs until December 1. You'll also get to spin the Black Friday Sale Wheel for spending over $15, which gets you everything from discount coupons to free games. Arc Raiders $34.39 (was $40) The standard edition of Arc Raiders gets you the base games, and purchasing at Fanatical gets you an official Steam key. But if you'd like a few in-game goodies, the Deluxe Edition is also on sale at Fanatical for $52.79 (was $60). This version includes extra cosmetics plus 2,400 Raider Tokens, the premium in-game currency used for cosmetic purchases. Here's a full look at what you'll get in the Deluxe Edition: Wanderer Set: Valente Outfit, Pathfinder Backpack, Blanket Roll Backpack Attachment Character Cosmetic Finger Gun Rapid Fire Emote Cowboy Scrappy Body Type and Skin 2,400 Raider Tokens See at Fanatical (Standard) See at Fanatical (Deluxe) Our Arc Raiders review gave it a resounding 9/10, thanks to its engaging gunplay, unique world design, and challenging endgame content. \"Arc Raiders is an extraction shooter, which means there are technically several popular games like it, but I've never played a game in the genre that's as unpredictable, thrilling, and--perhaps most surprising of all--hopeful,\" wrote critic Mark Delaney. \"We can all kill each other in Arc Raiders. The fact that most of us are choosing instead to lend a helping hand, if not a sign that humanity will be all right in the real world, at the very least makes for one of the best multiplayer games I've ever played.\" Arc Raiders isn't the only great shooter on sale at Fanatical. Thanks to the retailer's Black Friday sale, you can pick up another extraction shooter, Escape from Tarkov, for $37.49 (was $50), which offers a similar PvPvE experience, though it's not quite as beginner-friendly as Arc Raiders.

    "description": "Best Choice Products 10-in-1 Gaming Table $120 (was $300) See at Walmart See at Amazon ($170) Walmart's Black Friday sale is officially live, and one of the standout deals is a 60% discount on the Best Choice Products 10-in-1 Gaming Table. The multi-game table includes pieces and tabletops for foosball, air hockey, pool, chess, and more. Right now, you can snag it for just $120 (was $300). Since this Black Friday deal won't stick around forever, it's possible it could sell out fast. If it does, Amazon is discounting the table to $170 instead. Best Choice Products 10-in-1 Gaming Table $120 (was $300) The Best Choice Products 10-in-1 Gaming Table features interchangeable tabletops and 50 accessories to play 10 different games. It's quite small at two feet by four feet, so you should have no problem finding a place for it in your basement or game room. But keep in mind that this size also means a lot of the games aren't played on regulation-size surfaces. Kids, however, should find it to be plenty entertaining, with the option to enjoy several different games without the need to consume your home with several different tables. When you're not using one of the interchangeable tabletops, they can be stacked for compact storage. Here's what games you'll get to play: Slide hockey Foosball Billiards Shuffleboard Table Tennis Chess Cards Checkers Bowling Backgammon Walmart's $120 price applies only to the Walnut wood version; the other variants are priced at $170. See at Walmart See at Amazon ($170) Like the idea, but wish the price was under $100? Then check out the 3-in-1 Multi Game Table, as it's discounted to $89 (was $250). It's not quite as jampacked with games, but you'll still get access to billiards, air hockey, and foosball--and the table's overall dimensions are about the same. For something different, the Costway Electronic Shot Basketball Arcade Game is $90 (was $209), giving you a fun way to practice your shot when there's snow on the driveway. Featuring sound effects, an LED scoreboard, and multiple game modes, it's a cool alternative for any basketball fan. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
