You'll also find the Logitech G Astro A50 Wireless for $240 (was $300) and the Logitech G Astro A10 Gen 2 Wired Headset for $50 (was $70). Check out a full breakdown of the discounted headsets below, and be sure to browse GameSpot's Black Friday Deals Hub for price cuts on other PC gaming hardware, Blu-rays, books, and more. Logitech G Astro A50 X Wireless Headset $330 (was $400) The Logitech G Astro A50 X is the most luxurious of the trio of products on sale for Black Friday. Available in black or white, it supports PS5, Xbox, and PC, and you can switch between them simultaneously at the press of a button. You can also use it with Nintendo Switch while the console is docked. The main attraction, however, is unique HDMI 2.1 Passthrough technology, offering 24-bit/48kHz audio that should impress even the most discerning audiophile. Aside from its cool HDMI tech, the headset is equipped with everything else you'd expect from a $300+ gadget. This includes Pro-G Graphene audio drivers (40mm), the ability to listen to two devices at once, up to 24 hours of battery life, and a mobile app to help you optimize its performance. There's also an included docking station with LED lights that lets you quickly recharge your headset between play sessions. See at Amazon (White) See at Amazon (Black) Logitech G Astro A50 Wireless Headset $240 (was $300) This offers many of the same features as the A50 X, though it skips out on the HDMI Passthrough technology. Beyond that, you can still connect to PS5, Xbox, Switch, and PC, you'll still get Pro-G Graphene audio drivers (40mm), and you'll still get an included base station for charging. The same mobile app also lets you tweak a variety of settings like stream output mixing, mic settings, and other variables, and the overall design of the A50 is essentially the same as the A50 X. Note that if you're playing on PC, this will support the same 24-bit/48kHz as the A50 X. On console, performance drops to 16-bit/48kHz. In short, if you're playing just on PC, this is the headset to get. If you're playing on console, you'll have to decide if the slight performance bump of the A50 X is worth an extra $90. See at Amazon Logitech G Astro A10 Gen 2 Wired Headset $50 ($70) Just need a reliable headset that won't break the bank? Take a peek at the Logitech G Astro A10 Gen 2 now that it's just $50 (was $70). Its stat sheet won't blow you away, but priced at $50, it's a pretty good deal. The wired 3.5mm connection supports PS5, Xbox, Switch, and PC, a flip-to-mute microphone makes it easy to chat with teammates, and its 32mm drivers should be good enough for most casual players. Logitech built the headset to be durable too, with a flexible headband that can take a beating and oversized earcups that should be comfy during long play sessions. Several different colors and patterns are on sale--making it easy to find something that fits your style.

    "description": "The Grinch: Christmas Adventures $25 (was $40) See at Amazon If you're shopping for video games that could be perfect gifts for kids, consider picking up this early Black Friday deal on The Grinch: Christmas Adventures. The PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch versions of the family-friendly platformer are all discounted to just $25 (was $40) at Amazon. We don't know how long this limited-time deal will last, so it's worth picking up while you still can. The Grinch: Christmas Adventures $25 (was $40) The Grinch: Christmas Adventures standard edition includes a boxed copy of the game. The full game data is included on the disc (or the cartridge, in the case of the Nintendo Switch). That said, unlike previous eras of gaming where you could simply pop a new game into your console and start playing right away, newer titles often need to install at least some game data to the console's hard drive, which can take several minutes. So if you're planning to give this to a family member, a pro move would be to open the case and insert the disc in the console so all the data is installed, then wrap the gift once it's complete so they can start playing right away. See at Amazon The Grinch: Christmas Adventures is a kid-friendly game that lets players explore Who-Ville as the Grinch, tackling platforming sections through the town's outskirts, snowboarding stunt sequences, jetpack challenges, and more. The Grinch's dog, Max, is also a playable character with his own unique missions, and the game is full of collectibles that let you unlock jigsaw puzzles, art, and Grinch-y accessories. The game first launched back in 2023, but has remained surprisingly popular with players, and it even received a new DLC expansion last month titled The Grinch: Christmas Adventures - Determined to Love Christmas. The expansion is available as a $10 premium download on the PlayStation Store, Xbox Store, and Nintendo eShop. There are plenty of other early Black Friday video game deals available at Amazon.

Our Battlefield 6 review gave it a 7/10, shouting out its impressive gunplay and new features like crouch sprinting and dragging downed enemies that add a new twist to the usual Battlefield formula. Battlefield 6 features both a single-player campaign and online multiplayer, but it's the latter that's earning the most praise. \"Battlefield 6 is a return to form, even if it doesn't reach the same highs as the series at its peak,\" wrote Richard Wakeling. \"The campaign is as lackluster as expected, and the multiplayer maps are only ever decent at best, but there's still a chaotic and super-satisfying shooter here that offers multiplayer thrills unlike any other. Even if you're not racking up kills by the dozens, you're still rewarded for contributing in other ways, and you're never too far away from being in the middle of a histrionic Battlefield moment.\" Plenty of other video games, Blu-rays, and more are on sale in Amazon's Black Friday sale.

The brutal shooter earned high marks from critics, and if you haven't yet checked out the latest entry in the storied franchise, it's an easy recommendation at this new price. Doom: The Dark Ages $50.39 (was $70) Doom: The Dark Ages standard edition includes the base game on either PS5 or Xbox Series X. The game serves as a prequel to both Doom (2016) and Doom Eternal, and bridges the storylines of the 90s Doom games with this new reboot trilogy. Note that Amazon's deal applies to the physical version of Doom: The Dark Ages on both Xbox Series X and PS5. You can also play the game via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. See at Amazon Doom: The Dark Ages can be challenging, but since you can scale its difficulty, it's a good starting point for players of all skill levels. Our Doom: The Dark Ages review awarded the game an 8/10, highlighting its brutal combat, sprawling battlefields, and an updated arsenal that includes some of the series' best weapons. \"It's surprising how much Doom: The Dark Ages manages to rein in some of the changes Doom Eternal made while also taking the series in a wholly new direction that redefines its rules of engagement,\" wrote critic Alessandro Barbosa. \"The emphasis is on melee combat that harmonizes beautifully with the tried-and-tested pace of Doom's action, making each new attack parried and counter-attack landed feel as satisfying as the first. It's a finely tuned adventure that delivers the power fantasy of ripping and tearing through thousands of demons without losing an underlying complexity that makes each encounter engaging to blast through.\" Plenty of other cool products are on sale for Black Friday, so be sure to check out our dedicated Black Friday 2025 Deals hub for even more limited-time offers.

    "title": "Black Friday - Save On One Of The Best Leverless Fight Sticks",
    "description": "Razer Kitsune All-Button Arcade Controller $226 (was $300) See at Amazon Modern fighting games are designed for standard gamepads, but nothing matches the precision and feel of a dedicated arcade-style controller--especially the popular all-button \"leverless\" style fight sticks. While these can be quite expensive, one of the best devices of this style, the Razer Kitsune--which supports PS5 and PC--is on sale for $226 (was $300) at Amazon. The discount is part of Amazon's Black Friday deals, which include a variety of other gaming peripherals and controllers, as well as discounts on games, movies, and more. Razer Kitsune All-Button Arcade Controller $226 (was $300) The Razer Kitsune is a leverless, all-button fighting game controller, meaning it replaces a traditional joystick with dedicated direction buttons. Leverless fight sticks have become very popular within the fighting game community thanks to their quicker, more precise inputs. While it might take some time to adjust to the all-button layout (especially if you are already used to a traditional fight stick), once you do, you'll be pulling off combos and special attacks with ease. Like several other Razer products, the Kitsune has a super-thin profile and Chroma RGB lighting around the base of the chassis. The aluminum faceplate is also removable, allowing for easy tinkering with the controller. It comes fitted with low-profile optical linear mechanical switches. One thing to note here is that the Kitsune is only compatible with PS5 and PC, which is a bit of a shame considering that the PS4 still has a very active community of fighting game fans. See at Amazon \"The learning curve is quite steep, but the payoff is well worth the effort. The lack of native PS4 support is disappointing, which would be a dealbreaker for some. But from its build quality and physical design to the ergonomics and actual performance in competitive scenarios, it's nearly impossible for me to find a notable flaw in my 20-plus hours using it,\" Michael Higham wrote in GameSpot's Razer Kitsune review.

    "title": "Hell is Us Is $10 Off In Amazon's Early Black Friday Sale",
    "description": "Hell is Us $40 (was $60) See at Amazon New-in-box copies of Hell is Us are discounted on Amazon as part of their Black Friday deals. You can get the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X versions for $40 (was $60). The semi-open world action RPG launched just a few weeks in September, so this discounted price is a good time to jump in if you've been curious about the game. Hell is Us $40 (was $60) The standard physical edition of Hell Is Us comes in a standard box and includes the full game on your platform of choice. There is no extra content like the Deluxe Edition. It's not a short adventure by any means, so even the base game offers plenty of content to keep you engaged in its world and combat for hours to come. The game is also identical across PS5 and Xbox, though technical performance is a smidge smoother on Xbox, in case you happen to own both systems. See at Amazon Hell is Us is a dark and dreary open-world action game that refuses to hold your hand. Compared to other similar games, there are no overwhelming map markers, excessive side quests, points of interest, and so on. Instead, the game encourages you to find your own way through its world without giving you so much as a hint. For some gamers, this may be a hindrance, but seasoned veterans of the genre may appreciate the change. Despite this, the world is much more forgiving than you'd think, and doesn't aim to make exploration too complicated, at least according to our 7/10 review by Alessandro Barbosa. For more Black Friday deals, check out GameSpot's hub for all the latest discounts on video games, Blu-rays, anime, and much more. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
