TMNT Trilogy Limited Edition features 4K Blu-ray editions of the early '90s live-action movies for $58 (was $100). The 4K restorations are accompanied by new bonus features and archival content as well as multiple posters, a booklet with new commentary, trading cards, and more collectibles. Arrow Video's limited editions are actually limited, so once TMNT Trilogy sells out, any future printings won't include the collectibles. If you need a holiday gift for a TMNT fan, Amazon's store page says Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Trilogy will arrive with a few days to spare (as of December 16). The TMNT Trilogy is also available on 1080p Blu-ray, but it's actually more expensive than the 4K Blu-ray edition at the moment. Fans can also get the newly restocked TMNT: Mutant Mayhem 4K Steelbook Edition for $25.89 and the recently released TMNT: The Last Ronin Graphic Novel Box Set for $60.90 (was $95).

Like Fanatical's other build your own bundle promotions, you can pick as many games from the list as you'd like, and the more games you buy, the more you save. To start, you can pick up to four games for $3.33 each. At five or more games, you'll pay $3 per item. Grab 10 or more games, and you'll pay just $2.90 per game, and if you want the full 22-game bundle, it'll run you $63.78, a $547.75 value--not too shabby for literally thousands of hours of entertainment. See bundle at Fanatical One of the items you can pick, the SteamWorld Classic Bundle, comes with four games: SteamWorld Dig, SteamWorld Dig 2, SteamWorld Heist, and SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech.

You don't need to extract to complete Groundbreaking, but you'll receive the Blue Gate Communication Tower Key upon accepting this request, so you need to bring it into the raid with you. As such, you'll want to bring an augment with a safe pocket so that you don't accidentally lose this key during your journey to Pilgrim's Peak. If you do lose it, you'll have to wait to find another one (which is entirely random) or just hope you can catch the door open from someone else's key at some point.

It shows what games you played, how much time you spent playing, and other simple stats from the year. Many platforms now do yearly summaries like this, with Spotify Wrapped starting the trend, and services like YouTube and Twitch followed by showing users what they watched and enjoyed in 2025. Valve's Steam Replay covers your playtime from January 1, 2025, through the end of December 14, 2025. This gives players a clear picture of most of their gaming year, and also focuses on their habits--such as how many games they played games with either a keyboard or controller--and highlights their most-played games. This year, I finally really got into games on Steam with Peak and Repo, and I'm still dabbling with Lethal Company. It's the most wonderful time of the year - Steam Replay 2025 is now available!Take a trip down memory lane and see how many games you played, how much you played per month, and many more fun stats for the year.Check out yours (login required): https://t.co/Zq9vxaFit4… pic.twitter.com/SrVS9oNdIP — Steam (@Steam) December 16, 2025 Other gaming platforms have also released their yearly summaries, as PlayStation posted its yearly wrap-up last week.

    "description": "In January 2026, it will be seven and a half years since the announcement teaser for The Elder Scrolls 6. In that time, Bethesda has had remarkably little to say about it or even a trailer to show off. Now, Bethesda's Todd Howard has indicated that most of the Bethesda team is working on The Elder Scrolls 6. \"It's progressing really well,\" Howard told Game Informer. \"The majority of the studio's on [Elder Scrolls 6]. but I'll say this: We always overlap. So, we're very used to overlapping development. And we have long pre-productions on things so that we feel good about them. And it's a process. We all wish it went a little bit faster--or a lot faster--but it's a process that we want to get right.\" Although the initial announcement came years ago, it's possible or even likely that development didn't ramp up on The Elder Scrolls until after Starfield was released in 2023.
