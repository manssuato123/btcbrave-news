The Gibson SG 20th Anniversary Edition retails for $135 and is slated to launch December 19. Notably, this is the first wireless guitar controller in CRKD's catalog licensed by PlayStation. The Gibson SG syncs wirelessly to PS5, PS4, PS3, and PC via a 2.4GHz dongle. The multiplatform version of CRKD's Gibson Les Paul Guitar Controller is limited to a wired connection on PS5 and PS4, so the Gibson SG is likely the better option for Fortnite Festival and Rock Band 4 players on PlayStation. PS5 players now have two officially licensed wireless guitar controllers to choose from. The other is the PDP Riffmaster, which is still on sale for its $110 (was $150) Black Friday price.

The new thriller from director Yorgos Lanthimos and producer Emma Stone--who also stars in the film alongside Jesse Plemons--wasn't a box office hit, but it's certainly an unforgettable movie. If you missed it when it came out, you can preorder it now ahead of its December 23 release, with options for a limited-edition 4K Blu-ray, standard 4K Blu-ray, standard Blu-ray, and DVD. Bugonia Collector's Edition Steelbook (4K) $38 | Releases December 23 The Collector's Edition steelbook cover uses Bugonia's theatrical posters for its exterior and interior artwork, which hint at the film's weird, conspiratorial tone. Like other Blu-ray releases, you'll get the film on a 4K Blu-ray disc, a standard Blu-ray disc, and a digital streaming code to watch it online. For bonus features, the Blu-ray includes a documentary on the making of Bugonia, interviews with the cast and crew, behind-the-scenes footage, and more.

The film follows two conspiracy-obsessed cousins (Plemons and Aidan Dobis) who are convinced that the CEO of a powerful company (Stone) is actually an alien in disguise, hellbent on wiping out humanity. After kidnapping and trapping her in their basement, the trio engages in a battle of wits, interrogation, and torture, with the film becoming increasingly unpredictable as it races towards its conclusion. While it wasn't a box-office hit, Bugonia did earn relatively high praise from critics and audiences alike thanks to the standout performances of the cast and its wild plot twists. For more Blu-ray deals, you can check out various specials right now. The Hobbit Trilogy on 4K Blu-ray has gotten a big discount, and the box set for the A Better Tomorrow Trilogy has also gotten a substantial price cut. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Players will have a chance to earn Mega Stones for the Hoenn starter Pokemon--Sceptile, Swampert, and Blaziken--during the next few seasons of the game's online multiplayer mode. Like other special Mega Stones, these elusive items are not otherwise obtainable in the game, so you'll need to participate in Ranked Battles if you want to snag them. Sceptilite will be available during Season 5; Swampertite will be distributed during Season 6; and Blazikenite can be earned during Season 7. As before, you'll need to hit a certain rank before the season ends to earn the Mega Stones.

    "title": "Tron: Ares Is Getting A Steelbook Edition 4K Blu-Ray",
    "description": "The third entry in Disney's cult-classic sci-fi franchise, Tron: Ares, premiered in theaters earlier this year. The film expands the franchise's mythos with a new story centered on the titular Ares (Jared Leto), a self-aware artificial being who manages to exit the virtual reality of Tron and enter the real world. If you missed it, or you're already a fan and want to add it to your collection, preorders are now live for the Tron: Ares Blu-ray, which releases on January 6, 2026. The film will launch in multiple formats, including a limited-edition steelbook version that you can preorder for $45 at Amazon. Standard edition 4K Blu-ray, regular Blu-ray, and DVD versions are also available. Tron: Ares Limited-Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray) $45 | Releases January 6, 2026 The steelbook edition features artwork of the film's primary cast on the front, and the stylish teaser poster for Tron: Ares on the rear. On the inside, you'll find a screenshot from the movie pulled from the action-packed lightcycle chase scene. The movie supports Dolby Atmos and HDR10, and it includes a selection of featurettes that examine the production of Tron: Ares. Director Joachim Rønning and star Jared Leto appear in several of these short documentaries to talk about their passion for the Tron franchise, and several deleted scenes are also included. See at Amazon See at Walmart Tron: Ares (4K Blu-ray) $50 - 30 | Releases January 6, 2026 The regular 4K edition features a cover based on the Tron: Ares poster that featured a gravity-defying lightcycle ride up a skyscraper. This version includes the same special features as the steelbook edition, along with the aforementioned standard Blu-ray and digital copies of the movie. Along with these 4K editions, the Tron: Ares standard Blu-ray and DVD versions are also available to preorder. See at Amazon See at Walmart Tron 3-Movie Collection (DVD) $35 | Releases January 6, 2026 All three Tron movies will also be released as a bundle, but the strange thing is that this collection is only on DVD. The DVD listing doesn't mention special features either, so it looks like this will likely be a film-only release.

The movie grossed only $142 million worldwide and received lukewarm critical reception at best. Audience reviews have been kinder, and while the film may not have reached the same heights as the original Tron or 2010's Tron: Legacy, there is still appreciation for how it pushes the franchise's concepts further and for its hard-hitting Nine Inch Nails soundtrack. Unlike the Tron movies, which were set on the digital frontier of the Grid, Tron: Ares explores the ramifications of that world crossing over into ours. Centered around Ares, a highly sophisticated Program, the movie chronicles the first meeting between humanity and digital AI beings. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Last week, Netflix put forth an $82 million deal to purchase Warner Bros. Studios, one of the biggest movie and TV studios in the world. Warner Bros. also has a considerable place in the video game industry with franchises like Batman, Harry Potter, and Mortal Kombat under its domain. However, one Netflix executive has now acknowledged that Warner Bros.' gaming division wasn't a significant factor in considering its bid. During a Netflix conference call about the potential WB sale, co-CEO Gregory K. Peters expressed some eagerness to exploit the video game franchises under Warner Bros. in the future. But he added that the games were \"relatively minor\" in the company's initial plans and that it may be \"worth going back again to sort of how we thought about the deal and building our valuation model.\" \"While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space, we actually didn’t attribute any value to that from the get-go because they're relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things,\" continued Peters. \"Now we are super excited because some of those properties that they've built--[Hogwarts Legacy] is a great example of that--have been done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we're offering. They've got great studios and great folks working there. So we think that there's definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven't built that into our deal model.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",
