Paramount was perceived to be the frontrunner to buy Warner Bros. for months before Netflix swooped in, with CEO Ted Sarandos personally meeting with US President Donald Trump to try to woo him. Paramount is run by David Ellison, the son of billionaire Oracle boss Larry Ellison, and the family also has a close relationship with Trump. Paramount's new deal to buy Warner Bros. offers \"superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion to WBD shareholders,\" Paramount said. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

GameStop said in a news release that it took in more than 80,000 trades across the US on December 6 alone, and people brought in lots of unexpected and usual items, including a taxidermied bobcat and goose, a speed limit sign, a Wii Netflix disc, a bowling ball, a tiny Jesus, and \"a literal can of whoop-ass.\" This was all done as a marketing campaign to raise awareness for GameStop's trade-in program. The retailer also noted that people brought in \"a significant number\" of canned food goods to support food banks and pet shelters. One person attempted to trade in their dog (presumably as a joke, we hope!) but was rejected. Another person tried to trade in their Social Security card but GameStop said no.

In fact, they're aiming to start shooting in Summer 2026 and \"get back on the air in a reasonable amount of time,\" according to executive producer Jonathan Nolan. Speaking with IGN, Nolan was asked about Fallout Season 3, as Season 2 debuts December 17 on Prime Video. \"Oh boy. Well, I will say, with regard to production, we're hoping to be shooting again next summer,\" Nolan said. \"You know, we'll see if that comes together.\" Nolan believes with the talent of the cast and crew--giving special mention to creators Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner--they'll \"work quickly enough to get back on the air in a reasonable amount of time.\" Until then, Fallout Season 2 will release episodes weekly through early February. This is a major change from the first season, when all episodes dropped at once. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Of course, that's what most developers would say. Perhaps more intriguingly, Kojima discussed with ananweb (translated by Automaton) how he does not know for sure if his idea for OD will even work. \"I can't say exactly what it is yet, nor do I know if it will work out. We've created stealth games and delivery games which were unlike anything before, but system-wise, they were similar to other games,\" he explained, referencing Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding. \"This time, we're trying to change the service model from the ground up, so it should be quite challenging.

    "description": "There are well over 200 individual Grow A Garden seeds you can plant in your plot of land in the Roblox game. Each one has a different rarity and value, and depending on the type of plant, they can either be harvested once or will keep growing new fruits indefinitely after you sell the ones you pick. However, with such a high turnaround for events and their exclusive seeds, you may wonder if there is another way to get them. Luckily, with recent changes to the game’s structure, there is now a way to get some older plants that were available during the Spring and Summer. Of course, once you get the high-value plants, you’ll want to have them grow, then expose them to as many Grow A Garden weather events as possible to increase their value with multipliers added to them via Grow A Garden mutations. Here are all the ways you can get your hands on Grow A Garden seeds and seed packs, including those you can only find during events. Table of Contents [hide]How to get Grow A Garden Seeds The Seed Shop has a wide variety of seeds you can purchase, though its stock is widely variable.How to get Grow A Garden Seeds The first way to get Grow A Garden seeds is to buy them from the Seed Shop. The catch is that there are varying odds on which plants will be available whenever the shop restocks, with the more common seeds restocking more often than those of higher rarity. As such, Transcendent rarity plants, such as Crimson Thorns, will seldom ever see a natural restock. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Which Grow A Garden fruits are of the prickly type? Each one of the hundreds of available plants has a type associated with it. Blueberries are, well, berries, while the invaluable early-to–mid game Bamboo plants are classified as woody. One of the more uncommon types is the prickly plants, and that’s an issue if you’re trying to turn in plants for a limited-time reward. Another thing you should be aware of is that fruits can have multiple types at once. For example, though the Rose is classified as a prickly fruit in this Roblox game, it’s also both a flower and a leafy-type plant. Cultivating crops with multiple types can be beneficial in the long run when handling requests during upcoming Grow A Garden updates. So, to know which Grow A Garden seeds you should plant in your plot to get prickly plants, here is a list of all the currently included plants of this elusive type. The in-game guide has all the Prickly plants listed in order of rarity if you type it in the search bar.Grow A Garden Prickly Fruits List There are currently 25 Grow A Garden prickly fruits to find in the game. However, only a handful of them are obtainable right now. This is because many of these were available in exclusive Grow a Garden seed packs during events earlier in the game’s lifespan. Some have made comebacks via the Daily Deals shop, but many others have not at the time of writing. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Neuro is an AI-powered VTuber created by streamer Vedal987, and she utilizes a large language model with rapid response times, and the ability to \"see\" screens, read her own Twitch chat, respond to speech in almost real time, and even play games. Now, she's attempting Minecraft's Hardcore mode--the permadeath version of Minecraft that wipes the game world as soon as one player dies. Vedal, along with fellow VTubers Crelly and Filian, has claimed that the Twitch stream will not end until the quartet complete the game. To complete Minecraft, the four need to get to The End to face off against the Ender Dragon--not an easy feat at the best of times, and certainly not when you're relying on a childlike AI to make the right decisions, follow instructions, and cheat death.

    "description": "Tekken development chief Katsuhiro Harada has announced that he'll be departing from the fighting game series and its publisher Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. Harada--who has worked on every Tekken game since the series first debuted in 1994--said in a social media post that the death of close friends in his life had led to him to consider how much time he had left as a creator, and after consulting PlayStation icon Ken Kutaragi, he decided to leave the publisher after spending 30 years working on the Tekken franchise. \"With the Tekken series reaching its 30th anniversary--an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to--I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close,\" Harada wrote in an online post. \"In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect. Those accumulated events made me reflect on the 'time I have left as a creator.' During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi--whom I respect as though he were another father--and received invaluable encouragement and guidance. His words quietly supported me in making this decision.\" I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025.With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.My roots lie… — Katsuhiro Harada (@Harada_TEKKEN) December 8, 2025 Harada added that he'd been gradually preparing the Tekken team for his departure, and he was grateful to have worked on the series and on several other games, such as Pokken Tournament and SoulCalibur. While Harada is leaving Bandai Namco, he mentioned he would share his next steps at a later date. In a separate post, Bandai Namco said it remains committed to future development and content for Tekken 8 and expressed gratitude to Harada for his decades of work. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "As 2025 winds down, the new biggest potential acquisitions of the year appear to be the $55 billion deal for EA by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and other investors and the more recent proposed $82 billion agreement for Netflix to buy Warner Bros. Studios. Now, a new report suggests that Netflix once considered buying EA and two other movie studios before the Warner Bros. negotiations came together. According to Bloomberg, Netflix executives previously debated whether the streamer should place bids for EA, Fox, and Disney. However, the management team reportedly couldn't agree on a deal and feared that its interest in those companies would hurt its standing with investors. The report doesn't include the details about when Netflix considered these acquisitions, especially since Disney is usually the company that buys other studios including Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. Disney purchased Fox's entertainment assets in 2019 following an extended approval process from government agencies around the world. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
