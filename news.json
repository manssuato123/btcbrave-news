The game had been set to release on Epic Games Store this week, but now Epic has banned Horses as well. Santa Ragione shared a lengthy statement on its site, as well as reproduced messages from Epic that broke the news about the cancellation a day before launch. The dispatch from Epic cites violations of its inappropriate content policy and hateful or abusive content policies. Epic also stated that Horses got an Adults Only rating, and those games are excluded from the store. In response, Santa Ragione mentioned that Epic approved the game for release just over three weeks ago, and that the actual rating for the game was M for Mature under the ESRB and PEGI 18 in international territories. The studio went on to explain again that Horses is not a sexually charged adult game. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Samus Aran might not be known as a chatty character, but a voice actor helps flesh out the heroine with grunts and mumbles. Jennifer Hale, probably best known as Commander Shepard in the Mass Effect trilogy, previously provided the voice for Samus in the first three Metroid Prime games. But for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, Erin Yvette voices the protagonist and Krystle Martin provides the motion capture, per Nintendo Life. This isn't the first time Yvette has worked with Nintendo. Her previous experience with the company includes voicing Neilnail in Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition and Great Fairy Cotera in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. Meanwhile, IGN asked Hale about reprising her Metroid Prime role recently, and the actress seemingly implied she wasn't involved this time. \"I don't know,\" Hale said. \"I have no recollection of recording it or signing a contract, so it could be no.\" Hale has been on the flip side of this before, too, with Bayonetta 3. She isn't the first voice actor replaced by Nintendo in recent years. In June, longtime Princess Peach and Toad voice actor Samantha Kelly revealed she was no longer playing those parts after not being involved with Mario Kart World. In 2023, Super Mario Bros. Wonder introduced a new voice for Mario and Luigi--Kevin Afghani. This came after Charles Martinet stepped back from voicing the iconic character following a 25-year stint.

    "description": "The Game Awards are coming up soon, and now host and organizer Geoff Keighley is hyping the event with some kind of real-world teaser campaign for something people believe is connected to Diablo. Others do not believe it is connected to Diablo. Some think it's for the next God of War game. Still others think it could be for The Elder Scrolls 6. All of these suggestions may be wrong, however. On November 28, Keighley posted the tex \"regal.inspiring.thickness\" along with an image of some kind of huge carving featuring humanoid people in the middle of a desert. On November 29, Keighley followed up with a Google Maps image showing the location of the marketing monolith in the California desert.

Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics said in an interview that some of the factors that he believes are contributing to Call of Duty's decline include \"community burnout, questionable creative and business decisions by Activision/Microsoft, and strong competition.\" In terms of the competition, Elliott called out Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders, along with Fortnite, which recently had a popular Simpsons season and launched its positively received Chapter 7. \"Xbox dropped the ball on the wrong year, as this year saw some of the most exciting shooter releases in years,\" Elliott told Eurogamer. \"Attention is scarce.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "It may come as no surprise that Valve has invested in emulation tech for Arm-based hardware, having just announced its first device running an Arm chip. But beyond its own hardware, Valve's support of open-source emulation projects may have laid the groundwork for playing your favorite PC games on Arm devices like mobiles and tablets--no ports necessary. Valve's upcoming Steam Frame headset is the company's first Arm-based device, making use of the open-source FEX emulator to run Windows-native games. As it turns out, Valve has had more of a hand in FEX's development than it initially appeared. In an interview with The Verge, Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais revealed that Valve actually initiated the FEX project, and has been largely responsible for its development. \"We were talking with a few developers that we knew were the right fit for an undertaking like that, a long-term thing that needed a very specific set of experts,\" Griffais explained. \"We worked hard on trying to convince these guys to start the project, and have been funding them ever since.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "In September, Electronic Arts revealed that there's a $55 billion deal in place to bring the company private under Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, the private equity firm Silver Lake, and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. Now, a new report indicates that the PIF may be given near complete control of the company, because Saudi Arabia is putting up most of the money to complete the deal. According to The Wall Street Journal, EA's potential buyers have disclosed that PIF would be given 93.4% of EA in a document filed with Brazil's antitrust regulator. Silver Lake would only own 5.5% of the company, while Affinity would have a much smaller share: 1.1%. PIF is also a major investor in both Silver Lake and Affinity, which would leave it with more power over EA. WSJ notes that sovereign-wealth funds like the PIF normally make much smaller investments in buyouts like this one, while private-equity firms would take the lead as the primary owners and investors. Saudi Arabia has already invested in several video game companies, including Nintendo and Take-Two Interactive. In this year alone, Saudi Arabian-owned mobile developer Scopely purchased Niantic's video game division, the company behind Pokemon Go and other mobile titles. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Last summer, Sony filed a lawsuit against Tencent over Light of Motiram, a game that the former alleges is a \"slavish clone\" of the Horizon franchise. Now, the two sides have apparently struck a temporary deal ahead of an important court hearing that may determine whether the case goes forward. As reported by The Game Post, a new filing in court acknowledges that Sony and Tencent have been \"engaged in discussions in order to resolve the current dispute.\" Most notably, Tencent asked for more time to respond to the motion for an injunction, and Sony agreed in exchange for certain concessions. The terms call for Tencent to pause all public promotion or testing for Light of Motiram while also agreeing not to argue in court that Sony delayed its request for emergency relief by granting the extension. The filing also notes an agreement between the two sides that Tencent won't ask for expedited discovery in connection with the preliminary injunction against Light of Motiram. It also calls for Tencent to hold the game to its Q4 2027 release window rather than moving it up. Finally, the court document revealed another area where Tencent and Sony see eye-to-eye. The two sides jointly requested that a hearing for Tencent's motion to dismiss and a second hearing held for Sony's injunction request be held on the same day: January 29, 2026.
