    "title": "Save On Sony's Noise-Canceling Headphones &amp; Earbuds",
    "description": "All Sony headphones on sale for Black Friday Save big on Sony's best headsets See at Amazon Sony's noise-cancelling wireless headsets have been popular since they were first introduced, and for Black Friday, you can save nearly 40$ on the tthe Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones, which are on sale for $49 (was $400). These offer high-quality audio, strong battery life, and are comfortable to wear all day. You can choose from four colors for this deal: Black, Midnight Blue, Silver, and Smoky Pink, and as an added bonus, you'll also get $30 Amazon credit with the black version. Amazon has similar deals on several other Sony headphone models, including the WH-1000XM6, WH-CH720N, and XM5 Earbuds, all of which are discounted and come with a bonus 60-day Audible subscription. Beyond Amazon's offerings, you can also save a whopping $190 on the Sony WH-1000XM4 wireless headphones at Best Buy, dropping them to just $160 (normally $350). We've outlined all of the best Black Friday deals on Sony wireless headphones below. And for even more savings on tech, video games, and beyond, be sure to check GameSpot's Black Friday Deals Hub. Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless ANC Headphones $248 (was $400) | Includes $30 Amazon credit Sony’s WH-1000XM5 features Auto NC Optimizer technology that adapts noise cancellation to your environment. It also sports a sleek matte black design with built-in controls on the earcups. The left cup houses physical buttons for noise-cancelling and ambient modes, while the right cup offers touch controls for playback, volume, and calls. The headphones support wireless Bluetooth pairing or wired connections via 3.5mm or USB-C. Battery life is roughly 30 hours with ANC enabled (or 40 hours with ANC off), and it supports fast charging to restore hours of playback time in just a few minutes on the charger. The headphones ship with a soft-shell carrying case and a USB-C cable. Amazon's deal knocks the price on the Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless ANC Headphones down to just $248 (was $400), and you'll get a free $30 Amazon Gift card as part of your purchase. See at Amazon Sony WH-1000XM4 $160 (was $350) While Amazon's deal on the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones is great, Best Buy has its own exclusive deal on the previous generation model, the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones. These are very similar to the WH-1000XM5 in form factor, features, and sound quality. While they aren't quite as powerful as the XM5 model, the XM4 headphones still offer excellent playback quality and noise cancellation. Battery life last up to roughly 30 hours, and the support quick-charge via the included charging cable. They also include handy features like touch playback controls, AI audio upscaling, and multipoint Bluetooth pairing so you can connect them to multiple devices simultaneously. Thanks to Best Buy's Black Friday doorbuster deal, you can grab these for just $160 (normally $350), making this the biggest Black Friday discount we've seen for Sony's headphones so far.

See at Amazon Sony Ult Wear Over-Ear Noise Canceling Bluetooth Headphones $148 (was $250) Amazon's other Black Friday deals for Sony headphones include the Sony Ultra Wear Over-Ear Noise-Canceling Bluetooth Headphones. While they're not quite on par with the tech in the WH-1000X line, they're still a solid choice for mid-range active noise cancellation. Note that this is the only Sony headphone deal at Amazon that does not include a bonus gift card or Audible subscription. See at Amazon Sony WH-CH720N $88 (was $171) | Includes 60 days of Audible If the above headphone models are outside your price range, you might want to check out the budget-friendly WH-CH720N, which are down to $88 (was $171). This is another pair of wireless noice-cancelling headphones, and though they lack some of the premium features of the other models we've covered, they also won't break the bank. You'll also get a complimentary 60-day Audible subscription along with the discounted price if you grab these at Amazon. See at Amazon Sony XM5 Earbuds $228 (was $248) | Includes 60 days of Audible For something more compact, the Sony XM5 Earbuds are on sale for $228 (was $248).

See at Amazon If you'd like to check out the newest model, the Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones have been discounted to $398 (was $460).

Johan, a 3D artist who has works on Arc Raiders, shared the origin story of Scrappy in a post on the game's official page. The real Scrappy is a rooster named Hakan who once crashed Johan's Zoom meeting while he was staying at his parents' house. Johan describes the rooster as, \"Friendly, cuddly, and blind in one eye. He had a habit of stepping in his food and tripping over himself. I adored him.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "World of Warcraft: Midnight, the eleventh expansion in the long-running MMO and the second chapter of the Worldsoul Saga, is set to launch on March 2, 2026. Positioned between The War Within (2024) and the future expansion The Last Titan, Midnight marks a major return to one of Azeroth's most iconic settings while pushing the overarching saga toward its cosmic climax. Revealed during this past summer and showcased heavily at Gamescom, the expansion signals a dramatic escalation in the war between Light and Void. Set in a fully rebuilt and reimagined Quel'Thalas, Midnight centers on a massive Void invasion led by Xal'atath, whose manipulations during The War Within left Azeroth vulnerable to the voidlord Dimensius. The Void now seeks to claim the Sunwell--a source of potent magical energy--and plunge the world into terror. Players will work to reunite the fractured elven tribes, forge alliances with ancient powers, and ultimately join the Light's armies in a desperate effort to repel the Shadow once and for all. Zones such as Eversong, Zul'Aman, Harandar, and the Voidstorm will be heavily featured for the campaign. Midnight introduces several major gameplay features and progression updates, including player housing, a long-requested addition to the game. The expansion also debuts a new Allied Race, the Haranir, an ancient, root-dwelling people from the hidden zone of Harandar whose flora-grown architecture evokes the natural magics of early Azeroth. Players will be able to choose their zone progression order after completing Eversong, offering additional flexibility in how the campaign unfolds. Alongside returning lore heavyweights such as Wrathion, Khadgar, and Alexstrasza, the story pushes deeper into the tumult of the Worldsoul Saga. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Whether it be issues with the game's new activities hub--the Portal--an unfulfilling grind for better loot, the implied irrelevance of old gear, the quality of missions that are available, or progress-stalling bugs, the argument for this being the lowest point in Destiny's history is strong--despite some other periods that put up competition for that title. While it's impossible to know how the playerbase at large will holistically receive the content I experienced at a two-day preview of Destiny 2's upcoming Renegades expansion, what I do know is that there is a lot there for the community to engage with, which already feels like a step up from the previous expansion The Edge of Fate. When Renegades launches in December, the first thing players will encounter is its campaign, which is serving double duty. Its first responsibility is as a continuation of The Fate Saga, the multi-expansion story that kicked off with The Edge of Fate. At the end of that release, we learned of a vague prophecy that foretold the end of everything, lest our player Guardians \"bind the Nine;\" a group of primordial, fourth-dimensional beings who pull the strings of Destiny's universe. But what does binding the Nine actually entail? That's the million-glimmer question at the heart of the saga. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Ubisoft has posted a job on Hitmarker for a technical sound designer for Beyond Good and Evil 2. The role calls for the person in question to have the duties of both a sound designer and an audio technical lead with an emphasis on creating audio assets, as well as proposing and integrating audio designs. More intriguingly, the listing reconfirms that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 will be a prequel to the original game that offers \"a seamless experience of exploration and space piracy across a solar system full of exotic locations, colorful characters and mysteries to uncover, solo or with friends.\" That suggests the sequel will have multiplayer functionality.

    "description": "Lego Ideas: The Insect Collection (1,111 pieces) $40 (was $80) See at Amazon See at Walmart Amateur entomologists, take note--Lego Ideas: The Insect Collection is down to its lowest price ever for Black Friday. The set hasn't seen many discounts over the years, but right now it's just $40 (was $80) at both Amazon and Walmart. Lego says that this is one of its sets that'll be retired soon, so if you want to add it to your collection, the current deal is hard to pass up. Lego Ideas: The Insect Collection (1,111 pieces) $40 (was $80) This colorful set lets you build three different insects: a blue morpho butterfly, a Hercules beetle, and a Chinese mantis. All three are fully posable and come with a tiny display stand, making it easy to show them off in your home. The beetle might be the coolest of the bunch, however, as it comes with a pair of attachable wings that connect to its thorax, which makes for a pretty eye-catching display. Since each insect comes with its own instruction booklet, you can build these solo or with a few friends. There are also digital instructions on the Lego Builder app if you'd like something more visual. Once completed, the insects are quite sizable. The Hercules beetle alone stands around 7 inches tall and 6.5 inches wide, so make sure you have plenty of space on your table or shelf to show off the trio.

    "description": "Cyberpunk 2077 had a disastrous launch in December 2020, but it's now sold more than 35 million copies, reaching that figure faster than The Witcher 3. As part of CD Projekt's earnings report, the Polish company disclosed the new sales figure for Cyberpunk 2077 and the context around it. Joint CEO Michal Nowakowski said Cyberpunk 2077's strong sales are a testament to the \"franchise's enduring power.\" The sales success also \"enables us to be even more audacious about charting its future,\" he said. VGC reminded us that The Witcher 3 needed about six years to achieve 30 million in sales, so Cyberpunk 2077 is selling at a faster rate. Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty expansion, meanwhile, has sold more than 10 million units. The Witcher 3 went on to sell more than 60 million units to become one of the top 10 best-selling games of all time. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
