    "description": "Rosetta Stone Lifetime Subscription $149 (was $399) See at Rosetta Stone While learning a language is challenging, it's never been easier to start, thanks to the abundance of learning apps and online classes. One of the longest-running and highest-rated of these is Rosetta Stone. The service offers comprehensive courses in 25 languages, all of which use a unique immersion learning style, making it one of the most effective language learning programs out there. Of course, as with any language-learning program, the trick is to stick with it--luckily, Rosetta Stone is offering a limited-time discount on lifetime subscriptions, dropping the price to just $149 (was $400), which could make it much easier to commit to the process. While the Lifetime Subscription is arguably the best deal, it's not the only Rosetta Stone discount. The 3-Month Plan is on sale for $48 (was $60; billed every three months), while the 12-Month Plan is $126 (was $240; billed every 12 months). While the Lifetime Plan includes all 25 languages (listed below), monthly plans only unlock a single language--making the lifetime subscription by far the best deal. All plans offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. Rosetta Stone also lets you gift plans to others, which could make this deal a fun holiday gift. Here's a look at all the options side-by-side: Rosetta Stone Subscription Discounts Lifetime Plan -- $149 ($400) (single payment) | Includes 25 languages 12-month plan -- $126 ($240) (billed annually) | Includes one language 3-month plan -- $48 ($60) (billed every 3 months) | Includes one language See plans at Rosetta Stone Rosetta Stone's deals are only available for a limited time, so be sure to sign up at these discounted rates before they disappear.

That is, if you're engaging with the Flickering Flames project and collecting the necessary Candleberries to complete it. These hard-to-find berries are necessary for filling out the project alongside a handful of other fairly common items. Even better, each time you fulfill a requirement in the project, you'll earn rewards like Raider Tokens or Merits--the latter of which goes toward the Gathering Candleberries event. Here's how to find candleberries in Arc Raiders, as well as everything you'll need to complete the Flickering Flames event. Table of Contents [hide]Arc Raiders Candleberries locations Arc Raiders Candleberries locations Candleberries can only be found during the new Cold Snap map condition. This map condition can occur on any map except Stella Montis, so it will be available fairly often for you to explore. To find Candleberries, you'll want to visit areas that commonly contain other fruits, such as those you need for Scrappy upgrades.

    "title": "How Horses' Ban Reflects The Gaming Industry's Double Standards And Emotional Immaturity",
    "description": "A tectonic shift in the political climate has given rise to a sharp increase in authoritarian practices and policies and made 2025 an unprecedented and disconcerting year for censorship, including for the video game industry. In the face of outstanding pressure on the payment processors powering storefronts like Steam and Itch, thousands of games--largely pertaining to adult subject matter that was sexual in nature and labeled NSFW--were either removed or deindexed from those respective stores. Though the uproar around these removals died down with time--partly due to loss of momentum pressuring these stores to rescind the bans, partly because certain free games were eventually reindexed on Itch--the recent release of Santa Ragione's Horses has brought the conversation back for another round before year's end. That's because, once again, a title with a significant amount of adult content (seriously, Horses fits a lot of taboo material into a fairly brief runtime) has found itself in the crosshairs of the ongoing puritanical culture war that's raging throughout the country, as well as in the world of video games. And as it continues, the controversy around certain games and their subject matter begins to raise questions about artistic expression, who in this medium is allowed to discuss and prominently feature adult-oriented content, and what kind of conversations and explorations of these subjects will the corporate powers in control of the industry permit. Horses is a notable development in this ongoing controversy for several reasons, not the least of which is the preventative measures taken against it. Whereas the bulk of the censorship mentioned here came well after games were released and available to play, affecting many games that had already been listed on these stores for some time, Horses has been facing an uphill battle leading to its release on December 2.

    "description": "Shooters are having a moment in 2025, with Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders topping the charts and attracting large player counts as the year comes to an end. The former title is a return to form for a legacy franchise, while the latter leads the charge for the fledgling extraction-shooter genre. Left in the dust in the shooter space, however, is Splitgate 2, a game that its makers thought would revitalize a genre they saw as growing stale. Developer 1047 Games released the first-person shooter in May, exuding extreme confidence in its product. Splitgate 2 tried to bank on nostalgia for old-school arena shooters, directly invoking Halo and even Titanfall. Yet, the game was also marred by contradictory decisions, adapting present-day monetization models and industry-wide fads like battle royale modes. Splitgate 2 is a blip in the big picture of 2025, but the issues and drama surrounding the title and its release were so prolific that the game is certain to be the subject of YouTube essays and analysis for years to come. From microtransaction controversies to studio CEO Ian Proulx donning the most egregious headwear possible in a livestreamed industry event, along with developer layoffs and an extremely unusual \"unlaunching\" of the game, 2025 was nothing but tumultuous for the Splitgate team.

    "description": "Baldur's Gate 3 has built a reputation as one of the best role-playing games ever made since it released a few years ago, and with Divinity, Larian certainly seems confident it can make something even better. But how can it be so sure? Speaking to GameSpot, CEO Swen Vincke explained that the D&amp;D tabletop roots of Baldur's Gate 3 could actually make things more difficult. \"One of the biggest struggles that we had with Baldur's Gate 3 is every single class has almost different rulesets, so getting players on board with that was quite complicated,\" Vincke told us. While those with D&amp;D experience (or a similar game like Solasta) may have felt like they were ready for Baldur's Gate 3 at launch, it does feature a number of class-unique mechanics that people have to learn. These range from the Barbarian's \"rage\" mechanic to the spell-slots system for magic-users, and it definitely puts D&amp;D veterans at something of an advantage. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Creative director Marco Ponte said the decision to delay the game was made \"after months of internal testing,\" along with discussions from fans. As a result of these discussions, the developer also decided to cut multiplayer co-op from the game. \"We know this may come as a disappointment, but we believe it is the right creative direction for an uncompromising vision of the world after Judgment Day,\" Ponte said.
