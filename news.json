On December 2, thieves targeted LA Sports Cards in Burbank and made off with $100,000 or more in Pokemon cards and other collectibles. The trio of thieves were captured on camera in KTLA 5's video report below. Store owner Kiet Nguyen noted that the thieves seemed to know just where to go to get the most valuable Pokemon cards in the store. \"Liquid assets\" of unopened Pokemon boxes were also taken, and will be easy to sell because of how common they are. Additionally, the thieves stole rare sports cards that featured Mickey Mantle and Ronaldo among others. The thieves were in and out of the store in around three minutes, and the report notes that this trio may have hit other card shops in Southern California. One of the thieves exposed part of his face during an earlier heist, and that could help police eventually track him and his partners down. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "For a minute there, a full-on remake of Obsidian Entertainment's Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 was apparently in development. However, the project appears to have been put on hold, according to a new report. According to Game File's reporting, new legal documents revealed that Aspyr and Lucasfilm Games were working on a full remake of KOTOR 2. Codenamed \"Juliet\" in the files, the project was a modern remake of the iconic 2004 RPG and was in development alongside the KOTOR remake, which developer Saber Interactive said is still coming. However, per Game File and unlike the KOTOR remake, development on the KOTOR II remake has ceased as recently as March 2025. Lucasfilm Games VP Douglas Reilly explained in depositions about the drama surrounding KOTOR II that, had the remake come to fruition, it would've contained the cut DLC that was teased when the game was announced for Nintendo Switch in 2022. \"'Juliet' was the codename for a project where we were going to do a full remake of KOTOR II,\" Reilly said. [It would have featured] modern art, modern gameplay, you know, keep the story and the characters and the general--the general content of KOTOR II, but remake it for modern hardware and modern machines with updated graphics and all those kinds of things. It was something we were discussing with Aspyr. ... The plan was that we would remake the content that was in the RCM as it relates to Star Wars in that Juliet project.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Yasuke and Noae weren't the first dual protagonists in an Assassin's Creed game. Twins Jacob and Evie were featured in Assassin's Creed Syndicate. Shadows had more pronounced differences between its two heroes than Syndicate did. Yasuke was built for physical confrontations while Naoe was refined for stealth. Lemay-Comtois acknowledged those differences and some of the backlash the team faced because of Yasuke's inclusion. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Microsoft originally rejected a pitch to bring Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 to PlayStation consoles, but the company eventually agreed, and this led to a \"whole avalanche\" of Xbox games on PlayStation. That's according to Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator Jorg Neumann. He told XDA-Developers that it was his own idea to bring Flight Simulator to PlayStation consoles, culminating with the launch of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 today, December 8, on PS4 and PS5. The 2020 Flight Simulator game eventually grew to become 300 GB in size, and there was so much content planned that Neumann said the game could grow to become 1 TB. So instead of doing that, the team made a new game, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and the game now only has 8 GB of space for a requirement, with everything else sent to the cloud. This way of packaging the game allowed the game to come to other platforms, Neumann said. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
