    "description": "In the first season of Prime Video's Fallout, Ella Purnell's Lucy lost one of her fingers to The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) and eventually replaced it with another ghoul's finger. Purnell has been vocal about her dislike for Lucy's \"poop finger,\" but it's coming back for Season 2. While speaking with IGN, Purnell offered a more positive assessment of Lucy's mismatched finger. \"I'm very fond of my poop finger,\" said Purnell. \"It's the thing that is the Wasteland that Lucy carries with her. It's quite literally a piece of the Wasteland. Some random ghoul's finger that she's now got stuck. Even if she was to go back to the vault to try to continue life as normal, she will always have this reminder.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

As players prep for this month's upcoming Expedition--an optional wipe that resets much of their progress in exchange for in-game rewards--they'll also be treated to the fresh Cold Snap update. This new content includes an additional snow-based map condition, a premium Raider Deck, and another event to complete for goodies. Here's everything we know about it so far. Table of Contents [hide]Cold Snap release date Cold Snap release date Arc Raiders' Cold Snap update will release on December 16, 2025. While we don't know an exact launch time for this update yet, the previous North Line update launched at 1:30 AM PT / 4:30 AM ET, so it's safe to assume this one may also launch in the wee hours of the morning for US-based players. The Cold Snap update falls just one day before the Expedition window opens, which will allow players to send their raider off and reset much of their in-game progress any time before December 22. This should give dedicated players at least a few days to see this fresh content on their current raider before sending them off and starting anew. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

But rather than fix the ability to send houses skyward, Blizzard is instead embracing it. When housing first arrived on December 2 as part of patch 11.2.7, it didn't take long for players to discover that, while the UI didn't show it, houses could actually be lifted off the ground using keybinds. The result was players making all kinds of airborne housing creations, including elaborate treehouses, airships, mechs, homes held up by kites, and everything in between. In a forum post, WoW community manager Randy Jordan (aka Kaivax) stated that instead of fixing the ability to elevate houses, Blizzard has with this week's scheduled maintenance actually made it easier by enabling proper controls to move houses upward.

    "description": "While we're still a couple of months away from Resident Evil Requiem's release, it looks like there could be a surprise return awaiting fans. Before it was removed, the PlayStation Store revealed new cover art for the game that featured longtime Resident Evil protagonist Leon Kennedy. PlayStation 5 players noticed the art on the pre-download screen for owners of the standard (non-Deluxe) version of the game. IGN later confirmed the art, which showed a stubbled and haggard-looking Leon hovering over Requiem's other main protagonist, Grace Ashcroft. Leon appeared similar to his Resident Evil 4 look, with his fur-lined leather jacket, albeit a bit more grizzled. High-res image of the official Leon S. Kennedy version of the Resident Evil Requiem Playstation 5 icon that Sony accidentally leaked. pic.twitter.com/UpmAjU1LCp — AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) December 9, 2025 Leon's inclusion in the game has been something that Capcom has vehemently denied, with even producer Masato Kumazawa denouncing alleged leaked images of Leon going around last month. \"There has been a photo lately of Leon with an eyepatch, and just basically saying there's a DLC or a new costume for Leon--but just to make sure, these are all fake news,\" he told Stevivor in an interview, and added not to believe anything at face value.

Skyrim continues to conquer every platform imaginable, and this time it's specifically 2021's Skyrim Anniversary Edition that's available on Nintendo's new console. This new version of the game does come with a few additional bells and whistles not found in the original Switch version, namely Joy-Con 2 mouse-control support. It also sports improved load times and performance in addition to features found in the original Switch version of Skyrim, like Legend of Zelda Amiibo support, Zelda-themed items, and motion controls. For those who already own the Anniversary Edition on the original Switch, the Switch 2 upgrade is available for free. Those who don't already own any version of Skyrim on Switch can buy it on Switch 2 for $60. Owners of the non-Anniversary Edition of Skyrim on Switch can upgrade to the Anniversary Edition for $20 and then receive the Switch 2 version for free. The Anniversary Edition includes the base game and its three official expansions, as well as access to Creation Club content made by players. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Nintendo Switch 2 Wheel Set for Joy-Con 2 $21.49 (was $25) See at Amazon See at Target If you're one of the many holiday shoppers who took advantage of last week's Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle promotion, you should check out this week's deal on the racing wheel attachment set. Nintendo's official Joy-Con 2 Wheel Set is on sale for $21.49 (was $25) at Amazon and Target. Deals on first-party Nintendo accessories are uncommon, so even though you're only saving $3.50, it's still a noteworthy deal. Designed for playing Mario Kart World with motion controls, the two-pack of steering wheels launched alongside the Switch 2 console in June. Nintendo Switch 2 Wheel Set for Joy-Con 2 $21.49 (was $25) The official Nintendo Switch 2 Wheel Set comes with one light blue and one red attachment that match the color scheme of the Joy-Con 2 controllers. The textured grips are nicer than a lot of third-party wheels and Nintendo's attachments from the Nintendo Wii era. Just like the Switch 2 console itself, the first-party steering wheels have magnetic connectors for the controllers. Large shoulder buttons (SL and SR) are built into the back of each wheel. See at Amazon See at Target Considering the popularity of the Mario Kart World bundle deal, which ended on Sunday, it wouldn't be surprising if Amazon and Target sold out of this deal. Last week, Amazon sold out of all three of Hori's new Mario Kart World-themed Joy-Con 2 wheel attachments. Themed around Mario, Peach, and Yoshi, the officially licensed $15 wheels launched December 5. Amazon lists all three as \"temporarily out of stock.\" For a larger Switch 2 racing wheel, check out the recently released Joy-Con 2 accessory by Numskull. Officially licensed by Nintendo, Numskull's attachment is table-mounted and has slots for both controllers. It launched for $30, but Amazon has since raised the price to $33.83.
