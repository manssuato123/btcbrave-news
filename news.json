It's time to check out these Black Friday deals on Apple Watches at Walmart. While multiple models are seeing discounts, one of the best budget-friendly options on sale right now is the Apple Watch SE second-generation line.

Starring Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey, the HBO show follows the pair as they journey across the post-pandemic US, a country devastated by an outbreak of a lethal Cordyceps fungus. The first season ran for nine episodes, and each episode is accompanied by a short documentary detailing its production. Additional bonus materials include featurettes on how the video game was adapted for TV, profiles of the actors, and how the TV show connected to the video game source material.

These bonus materials all originally aired on HBO, but the Blu-ray does include two exclusive special features: Ellie's Ultimate Revenge explores Ellie's motivations throughout Season 2 and Beneath the Surface: The Visual FX of The Last of Us offers a closer look at how the world around the characters was created with props and grisly special effects.

This version features substantially upgraded graphics and quality-of-life updates, as well as the Left Behind prequel chapter, new weapons, upgrades, visual filters, and a Speedrun Mode. The Last of Us Part 2 was already a good-looking game when it first debuted on PS4, but the PS5 version makes it look even better. The remastered version includes the original game and adds visual upgrades and levels featuring behind-the-scenes commentary from Naughty Dog developers. Additionally, you can explore three \"Lost Levels\" that weren't included in the game, test your skills in the roguelike survival mode No Return, and strum a few chords in Guitar Free Play mode.

    "description": "1TB SSDs $70 - $130 See at Amazon 2TB SSDs $135 - $190 See at Amazon 4TB SSDs $240 (was $328) See at Amazon Solid-state drives (SSDs) have come a long way over the years, evolving from expensive storage devices into affordable upgrades for PCs and consoles. For Black Friday, SSDs from various manufacturers are on sale, with a wide range of capacities available. Considering that modern-day video games require more storage space than ever before, a storage capacity is an essential purchase for PC and console players--and grabbing one while they're on sale is a great opportunity to add a terabyte or four to your devices at more affordable price points. To help you find the best deals, we've rounded up a selection of discounted SSDs in the lists below. You'll find models that work on PC and PS5, as well as proprietary storage card expansions for Xbox Series X, and MicroSD cards for Switch, Switch 2, and Steam Deck. We've also thrown in a few SSD heatsinks and external drive options as well. Note that these are all limited-time deals, so pricing and availability may change. Once you've browsed all the SSD drives below, check out GameSpot's Black Friday Deals Hub for the latest discounts on hardware, video games, Blu-rays, and more. 1TB SSDs $70 - $130 1TB NVMe SSDs are some of the cheapest devices on the market, and Amazon is offering several models for under $100 during Black Friday. The BIWIN Black Opal NV7400 is on sale for $70 when you click the coupon on its page, while the Acer Predator GM7 and Crucial P310 2280 are just $80 each. All three SSDs provide comparable read/write speeds. There are also officially licensed PS5 SSDs from Seagate and Western Digital, but these do cost more than the options listed above. For PC gamers, we'd recommend the Crucial P510 with read/write speeds of up to 11,000/9,500 MB/s. While it will work with PS5 consoles as well, the specs are pure overkill for that system. Crucial P310 2280 -- $80 ($109) Crucial P510 -- $100 ($130) Acer Predator GM7 (No heatsink) -- $80 with coupon ($101) Biwin Black Opal NV7400 (No heatsink) -- $70 with coupon ($95) WD Black SN850P -- $130 ($159) Seagate 1TB Game Drive for PS5 -- $120 ($135) See at Amazon 2TB SSDs $135 - $190 While an extra terabyte is great for your system, a 2TB SSD is even better. These don't cost much more than the 1TB SSDs, and you can get one like the Crucial P310 2280 for as low as $135. This has read/write speeds of up to 6,000 MB/s and 7,100 MB/s, making it ideal for PS5 consoles. The more expensive options here include the officially licensed Seagate PS5 SSD for $170 (was $215) and the Crucial T710 for $190 (was $320). The Crucial SSD is once again specced beyond what is required for a PS5 console, so PC power users looking to handle demanding programs and move large files will want to consider grabbing this one. Crucial P310 2280 -- $135 ($178) Seagate 2TB Game Drive For PS5 -- $170 ($215) Crucial T710 -- $190 ($320) See at Amazon 4TB SSDs $240 (was $328) A 4TB SSD is pretty big, but the benefit of installing one is that you'll future-proof your PC or PS5. One of the best deals we've seen so far for these chunky SSDs is the PS5-compatible Crucial P310, which will work just fine in a PC as well. It delivers up to 7,100 MB/s read and 6,000 MB/s write speeds, and it's on sale for $240 (was $328). See at Amazon SSD Heatsinks As mentioned above, some of these SSDs will require a heatsink. PS5 owners can get the Sabrent heatsink for just $10 (was $14), and it's designed to seamlessly fit an M.2 drive and replace the native PS5 cover when placed in the expansion bay. Constructed from high-quality CNC'd aluminum, this has been a popular choice because it efficiently disperses heat. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "How To Get A Free Kill Bill Fortnite Skin",
    "description": "After giving everyone a free Juice WRLD skin a year ago, Fortnite is once again offering a free licensed skin to mark the start of a new chapter. Anyone who logs into Fortnite between November 27 at 6 AM PT and December 1 at 6 AM PT will receive a skin based on Yuki Yubari, a character from Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill who didn't make the final cut of the movie when it was originally released. This Yuki Yubari skin is free to anyone who logs into Fortnite between November 27 and December 1.Back when Tarantino wrote his massive two-part epic Kill Bill, it included an additional sequence that was cut before filming, in which Yuki seeks revenge for the death of her sister Gogo, whom The Bride had killed during the battle at the House of Blue Leaves. Yuki finally sees the light of day in Fortnite Chapter 7, apparently. The Yuki Yubari skin is not actually in the Fortnite game files yet, so you won't be granted the skin until after Chapter 7 begins on November 29. Yuki is one of at least three Kill Bill-related skins coming to Fortnite in Chapter 7. The Bride herself will be included in the Chapter 7 Season 1 battle pass, and a skin based on Gogo Yubari will be sold in the item shop--and you can also earn it by purchasing a ticket in advance for a showing of Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair during its opening weekend.

    "description": "This may be the winter of discontent for some Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 players. Activision has been notably quiet about the game's sales, and has yet to share metrics or statistics. There's also been an uptick in anger from fans over conspiracy issues related to the game's Skill-Based Matchmaking mode. That's led Charlie Olson--the creator of CoD's SBMM--to directly address some of those concerns himself. OIson--who spent a decade at Raven Software under Activision--shared a lengthy video on his YouTube channel that dives into how his SBMM is supposed to work. He also took the time to explain why Activision's announcement about bringing \"open matchmaking\" to Black Ops 7 didn't mean the game was dropping SBMM. If fans were expecting the chance to cut down inexperienced or casual players, they've been disappointed. Olson argues that it means the game has been dominated by \"sweats,\" or experienced players, rather than rookie players. \"Some players are leaving because they thought this tweet meant SBMM had been completely removed from the game, and then they felt betrayed by the inclusion of one standard matchmaking playlist, and then blamed it for stealing 'fodder' from the open playlist,\" explained Olson. \"What's really going on here is there aren't enough casual players at launch to make open matchmaking the pubstomp that was expected or promise. If open lobbies are sweaty, it's because it's mostly sweats playing.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",
