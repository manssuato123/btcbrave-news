    "description": "Infinity Ward, the developer of the popular Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series, has told fans, \"Don't believe everything you read on the internet\" amid a rumor about next year's game. In a post on social media, the studio wished fans a happy holiday and teased that it's \"looking forward to talking soon.\" In the meantime, the developer said fans should be wary of what they read on the internet. Although there was no further context provided, this may be a reference to a recent report that claimed Infinity Ward is making 2026's Call of Duty game, rumored to be Modern Warfare 4, and that its multiplayer would be a \"complete copy\" of Modern Warfare 2's.

He was the original creative director on Rainbow Six Siege and comes back to Ubisoft alongside Alex Parizeau, the former managing director of Ubisoft Toronto. March of Giants is a 4v4 tactical multiplayer free-to-play MOBA inspired by technology from the early 1900s. The game combines elements of real-time strategy and lane-based combat. It's called March of Giants because players take on the role of a giant who is controlling troops on the battlefield.

    "description": "Germany's defense ministry is now funding tests to see if hissing cockroaches from Madagascar can be used as reconnaissance drones on the battlefield. It sounds like something out of a futuristic military video game, like Call of Duty. The defense ministry has announced that it's funding research and development at SWARM Biotactics to create technology that can \"steer cockroaches and send them on reconnaissance missions,\" CBS News reported. CEO Stefan Wilhelm said the cockroaches are \"super resilient\" and can crawl through \"tiny spaces,\" climb up walls, go into pipes, and navigate through rubble. How does this work? Neuroscientists at the company put electrodes on the critters' antennae to \"stimulate the insects' natural ability to navigate.\" They wear little backpacks carrying batteries and chips, with the bugs controlled through a game-style joystick. The researchers claim the cockroaches are not hurt by any of this. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
