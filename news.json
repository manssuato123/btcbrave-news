    "description": "Bethesda did a shadowdrop for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered earlier this year, and it was a big success. Another Bethesda-published game, Hi-Fi Rush, had a shadowdrop as well. Now, Bethesda Game Studios director Tom Mustaine is openly calling for more releases of this type in the future from other developers across the industry. Speaking to GamesRadar, Mustaine said the shadowdrop approach is a favorite of Bethesda boss Todd Howard, and releasing games like this can be a way to reach players who may have short attention spans. \"We all have short attention spans now,\" he said. \"There's Grand Theft Auto, for example. I want that today, right? So it is an interesting strategy ... I don't have any ideas of what would be next, but I hope it's not the last. Personally, I think it was great to own the internet for that day and, you know, give people exactly what they want the moment we talk about it. I'm a fan of that personally, but I'd love to see more people do it.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Doug Cockle, who voiced Geralt in the video games, has reacted to the change, saying Hemsworth has done a \"fantastic\" job taking over for Cavill and has made the role his own. \"I loved Henry. He was a fantastic Witcher, Geralt, specifically, so I was sad to see him go, but I have watched the newest season, and I think Liam holds up pretty well,\" Cockle told GamesRadar. \"He's different. He's made it his own character, and that's what he should have done as an actor, and I think he's done a fantastic job.\" Cavill announced in 2022 that he was leaving The Witcher, and this shocked and dismayed fans of the fantasy show. There was an online petition that gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures asking for Cavill to come back. It was around this time that Cavill announced that he would come back to play Superman again, but that didn't materialize. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Embark Studios' mega-popular extraction shooter Arc Raiders has some competition on Steam's most-played game chart, as there's a newcomer on the list: the free-to-play, open-world Wuxia fighter Where Winds Meet. Where Winds Meet is the debut title from Chinese developer Everstone Studio. Set during ancient China's Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (about 907 to 979 AD), the game is this fantastical amalgam of MMO, action-adventure, and RPG mechanics that seamlessly blends into an open-world environment you can play either in solo or multiplayer modes. There are epic sword fights with flashy combos, Tai Chi moves to basically force-throw animals and enemies, and bosses that rival a From Software game in size and difficulty. Not to mention the wealth of content in the first two regions--Kaifeng and Qinghe--that easily contain hundreds of hours of stuff to do, secrets to find, puzzles to solve, and baddies to beat up. The best part is it's all totally free. Almost everything you experience in Where Winds Meet is free to play. There are premium currencies to buy, a battle pass to purchase and upgrade, clothes and accessories to fill your (digital) wardrobe with--you know, \"free-to-play\" stuff. However, the action of the game--the bosses, the weapons, the main and side objectives, the minigames, etc.--doesn't cost you anything to play. That's true of future content as well. Since the game's Chinese servers get new features before the global ones do, players on those servers have shared what's coming to the game in upcoming updates, like new regions to explore and weapons to fight with.

Now, Valve has yet again commented on the pricing question, providing potentially the best clue yet, while also saying the company cannot or will not disclose pricing yet due to \"a lot of external things.\" Speaking to Skill Up--which is co-hosted by GameSpot's Lucy James--Valve software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais said people can expect the price of the Steam Machine to be close to what it might cost to build a PC with \"basically the same level of performance.\" \"I think that if you build a PC from parts and get to basically the same level of performance, that's the general price window that we aim to be at,\" he said, as reported by IGN. \"Ideally we'd be pretty competitive with that and have a pretty good deal, but we're working on refining that as we speak. Right now is just a hard time to have a really good idea of what the price is going to be because there's a lot of different things… a lot of external things.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

If you don't own a Switch 2, you can also grab the game on PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X, but like many of the other video game deals in Amazon's event, these Persona 3 Reload discounts could run out fast, so don't wait--it could be Dark Hour on these deals before you know it. Persona 3 Reload (Switch 2) $40 (was $60) Persona 3 Reload is a full-scale remake of the 2006 classic, introducing new characters, expanded storylines, an all-new voice cast, and a re-recorded soundtrack. The game also features quality-of-life improvements and a redesigned interface that refines the experience while preserving the heart of the cult-classic PS2 original. Note that the Switch 2 version of the game comes on a Game Key-Card, which means none of the game data is included on the cart. Instead, inserting the physical game into your system unlocks the digital version, which you must download to your console before you can start playing. Expect Persona 3 Reload to take up about 25GB on your Switch 2's internal storage or SD card. It's also worth pointing out is that the Episode Aigis DLC expansion is available a separate $35 purchase on the Switch 2 eShop. Episode Aegis adds roughly 30 hours of new story content that takes place after the base game's ending, along with new costumes and music. See at Amazon While Persona 3 Reload came to Switch 2 just a few months ago, it originally launched on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, and PC back in early 2024. The physical PlayStation and Xbox versions also happen to be on sale at Amazon, and at much lower prices than the Switch 2 version. You can check out all the Persona 3 Reload Black Friday deals below. All Persona 3 Reload Black Friday Deals Switch 2 -- $40 ($60) PS5 -- $18 ($70) PS4 -- $20 ($70) Xbox Series X -- $25 ($35.16) Persona 3 Reload is just one of several Atlus-published RPGs on sale at Amazon during Black Friday.
