    "title": "ROG Xbox Ally Gaming Handheld Is On Sale For Only $489 For A Limited Time",
    "description": "Asus ROG Xbox Ally Gaming Handheld $489 (was $600) Get deal at Amazon See at Walmart See at Best Buy See at Target Asus ROG Xbox Ally 2-in-1 Premium Case (Official) $70 See at Amazon See at Best Buy There's still time to save big on the first official Xbox gaming handheld. The Asus ROG Xbox Ally, which launched in October with a $600 MSRP, is on sale for $489 at Amazon and Walmart, $490 at Best Buy, and $520 at Target. It's still not entirely clear when this deal ends, but it's still available as of December 17. The $489 price at Amazon is an all-time low for the recently released Windows gaming handheld. Amazon has also restocked the official Xbox Ally 2-in-1 Premium Case. If you pick up the Xbox Ally at Amazon, you should also check out some of the third-party accessories available now, including docking stations, screen protectors, travel cases, and microSD UHS-II cards. Though it's sold out more often than not at Amazon, the official Xbox Ally 2-in-1 Premium Case is currently available to order. Asus ROG Xbox Ally Gaming Handheld $489 (was $600) The ROG Xbox Ally is an entry-level Windows gaming handheld with impressive features and performance for the price. The Ryzen Z2 A chip is comparable to Steam Deck's custom AMD APU, and if you increase the TDP--at the expense of battery life--the Xbox Ally can outperform the Steam Deck OLED. For reference, the Steam Deck OLED 512GB model retails for $549. The Xbox Ally has a 1920 x 1080p IPS display with 120Hz refresh rate and support for VRR and AMD FreeSync Premium. If you're comparing to the Steam Deck OLED, Valve's handheld has a 7.4-inch 1280 x 800p OLED display with HDR and 90Hz refresh rate. So the Steam Deck wins in panel type and size, but the Xbox Ally wins in resolution and refresh rate. That said, to get the best performance on Xbox Ally, you will often want to lock the resolution at 720p, so the Xbox Ally doesn't always take full advantage of its advantages. The Xbox Ally is arguably the most comfortable Windows gaming handheld on the market today. Asus opted for the PlayStation Portal approach by essentially splitting the Xbox Wireless Controller in half and connecting it to each side. Along with all of the buttons, triggers, and bumpers found on the Xbox Wireless Controller, the Xbox Ally has two remappable back buttons. It also has motion controls and HD haptics. One of the big selling points of the Xbox Ally is the custom, console-inspired dashboard that is easier to use than the traditional Windows interface. The Xbox Ally has a 512GB SSD, 16GB RAM, a microSD UHS-II card slot to expand storage capacity, two USB-C ports, and a headphone jack. Check out the Xbox Ally's specs and features below. If you want to read more about the Xbox Ally and the higher-powered $1,000 Xbox Ally X, check out our buying guide and our review of the Ally X. Specs: Processor: AMD Ryzen Z2 A RAM: 16GB LPDDR5X-6400 Storage: 512GB M.2 2280 SSD Display: 7\" IPS touchscreen (Gorilla Glass Victus) 1920 x 1080 120Hz refresh rate VRR supported AMD FreeSync Premium Controller Design: Contoured grips Hall Effect triggers Shoulder bumpers ABXY bumpers 2 remappable back buttons Analog sticks with light rings 6-Axis motion controls HD haptics 5 menu/settings buttons Ports: 2x USB 3.2 Type-C 3.5mm audio microSD: UHS-II reader (only UHS-II) Network: Wi-Fi 6E / Bluetooth 5.4 Battery: 80Wh Battery life: 1.5-5 hours Weight: 670g Dimensions: 290.8 x 121.5 x 50.7mm Get deal at Amazon See at Walmart See at Best Buy Game Pass Ultimate subscribers have a built-in library of hundreds of games for the Xbox Ally. Whether you already have a subscription or not, you'll want to purchase your membership from a major retailer instead of directly through Microsoft. The price of Game Pass Ultimate increased to $30/month in October, but major retailers still sell prepaid codes for $20/month. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Developer Santa Ragione is reporting that its controversial indie horror game Horses sold 18,000 copies in two weeks. That was apparently enough to save the studio from financial ruin, but perhaps not enough to pay for production a second game. According to a statement released by the developers, Horses generated $65,000 in net revenue, which allowed Santa Ragione to repay its loans and pay the royalties it owed to Andrea Lucco Borlera, the author and creator of Horses. However, the income won't allow the team to immediately begin working on another game. \"This result is not enough to begin production on a new game,\" reads the statement. \"The money primarily covers obligations created by a prolonged end of development. If sales remain steady, we may be able to fund a new prototype in the future, but the team has had to, and will continue to, take other jobs and projects in the meantime. Reuniting everyone will not be easy, even if it is something we would love.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Developer Techland has dropped Update 1.5 for Dying Light: The Beast, and it's giving players the chance to test their skills in the Nightmare Experience. To turn up the heat on players, human and infected enemies are now smarter, more aggressive, significantly stronger, and more reactive to the players' actions. Volatiles may now even appear during the day in some of the Dark Zones, and players have far fewer resources to deal with them all. If that wasn't enough, there's a new super enemy, the Alpha Volatile. Techland calls it \"the most intelligent Volatile in the history of Dying Light.\" It's even smarter than the traditional Volatiles and its heightened senses can track the player across the entire map unless they reach a safe zone. The Alpha Volatiles can be killed, but good luck trying to pull that off. At night, the player is the prey for this creature. Players can also get new finishing maneuvers, including one-handed blunt weapons and one-handed slashing weapons. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Preorders for the It: Welcome to Derry Limited Edition Steelbook initially sold out in hours, but it's back in stock at Amazon for $45 and Walmart for $57. If you're a Stephen King fan, it'd probably be wise to preorder ASAP. Steelbook Editions of the two-part It film adaptation sold out fast, and Welcome to Derry is the first TV series based on a Stephen King novel to get a 4K Blu-ray edition. At this time, the Limited Edition Steelbook is the only way to get the series on 4K Blu-ray. Welcome to Derry: Season 1 is available to stream in full on HBO Max. Alternatively, you can buy Season 1 on other streaming platforms like Amazon Prime Video for $22. Welcome to Derry holds an 80% on Rotten Tomatoes, and I think many longtime fans of King's legendary horror novel would say Season 1 was pretty great. HBO has yet to renew the series for a second season, but director Andy Muschietti has a three-season arc in mind. Season 1 tells the story of Pennywise's reign of terror in 1962. Season 2 would rewind the clock 27 years to Pennywise's previous feeding cycle in 1935, and Season 3 would be set in 1908. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Available for $61.74 (was $80), it lets you build a functional replica of the fun coin pushing games found at the arcade. This is the first real discount we've seen for the product, and it looks like a neat project to work on over the holidays. Sosuy Motorized Coin Pusher Arcade Game Building Set (2,093 pieces) $61.74 (was $80) While kids will have fun playing with the Coin Pusher Arcade Game once the build is complete, they'll probably need an adult to help snap together its 2,093 pieces. Not only are there a lot of pieces, but the kit features a bunch of moving parts that likely require a skilled hand to get working properly. For example, the finished game features a movable coin slot, a rotatable switch, and an electric motor drive. In other words, parents can have fun constructing the complex machine alongside their kids, making it a cool winter activity for the whole family. Once the building is done, the machine comes with everything you need to start playing like you're at the arcade, including dozens of durable plastic coins. See at Amazon The completed machine stands nearly 17 inches tall and 11 inches wide, making it a pretty robust project. It looks quite premium, too, with a retro yellow-and-red design and a little \"Coin\" marquee at the top by the coin slot. While the brand, Sosuy, doesn't have the name recognition of Lego, it's responsible for some unique building kits. Beyond this game, it sells a Bumper Cars Building Set featuring movable vehicles. It's also on sale ahead of the holidays, now just $48.44 (was $60) at Amazon. And though it's not discounted, the Water Slide Building Set offers a colorful design, a slidable track, a functioning chain to move its passengers, and spans nearly two feet when completed.

    "description": "Mad Max 5-Film Collection (4K Blu-ray) $49.49 (was $80) See at Amazon Nothing beats finding a freshly wrapped 4K Blu-ray box set under the Christmas tree, and if you're looking to spoil someone who enjoys \"Ozsploitation\" movies, then check out this limited-time deal on the entire Mad Max film saga. This 4K Blu-ray bundle launched for $100 last year, but it's now discounted to its lowest price yet at $49.49 on Amazon. It also comes with digital copies of all five movies. This is an awesome deal on one of the most acclaimed action film series, but the price cut ends until 11:59 PM PT, so you only have a few more hours to take advantage of the deal. Mad Max 5-Film Collection (4K Blu-ray) $49.49 (was $80) Set in a dystopian future where society has broken down in the wake of resource and water wars, the box set includes Mad Max, Mad Max: The Road Warrior, Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, Mad Max: Fury Road, and Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga. The slipcase also pays tribute to the film series, featuring artwork showcasing various images of the bandits and the vehicles that hunted down Max and Furiosa throughout each movie. This collection includes a curated selection of special features pulled from previous Blu-ray releases. You can sit down for several behind-the-scenes documentaries, deleted scenes, and featurettes that explore the chaotic world of the film series. What makes this edition special is that it is the only 4K Blu-ray box set to include the physical Black &amp; Chrome editions of Fury Road and Furiosa. Both movies look stunning in black and white, as each film was re-graded to create striking images bereft of color. The only downside to this collection is that there are no special features included for Beyond Thunderdome. Mad Max fans will be used to this, since no bonus materials were included on the original DVD or on standard Blu-ray copies of the film.

The Totally Awesome '80s bundle is available for $55, and it includes Top Gun, Trading Places, The Untouchables, Beverly Hills Cop, and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Considered among the greatest blockbusters of that decade, each film also comes with a digital streaming copy and special features.
