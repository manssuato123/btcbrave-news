    "description": "At The Game Awards, Lucasfilm and Mass Effect veteran Casey Hudson announced a brand-new Star Wars game called Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic. It was one of the biggest, most unexpected reveals from the event, and people are pretty hyped for it. The game is in early development and still a long way off (but reportedly due before 2030), and there is plenty we still don't know about pretty much all facets of the game. But for now, here's what we know so far about Fate of the Old Republic. We will continue to update this post as more details become available. Table of Contents [hide]When will Fate of the Old Republic be released? When will Fate of the Old Republic be released? Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic does not have a release date. Immediately following the game's announcement, people theorized that the game was a long way off, in part because Hudson only just started the studio making the game, Arcanaut, back in July 2025. His previous studio, Humanoid Origin, opened in May 2021 and closed in December 2024; the studio never released a game. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

I could not be prouder of what we created. And as always, a new actress receives this incredible gift to step into the boots.

    "description": "Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic was one of the big highlights of The Game Awards last week, but will it launch before 2030? Game director Casey Hudson has stepped in to address these reports--which may stem from Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier's speculation about when the game will be released--confirming that the spiritual successor to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic will arrive before the current decade is up. \"Don't worry about the 'not till 2030' rumors,\" Hudson wrote online. \"Game will be out before then. I'm not getting any younger!\" There's no concrete release date yet for Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, and it's still very early days for the project. The reveal trailer at The Game Awards was a CGI teaser for the game--similar to how Quantic Dreams revealed Star Wars Eclipse at The Game Awards 2021--and the developer behind Fate of the Old Republic is Arcanaut Studios, a company founded by Hudson and his partners in July. While it's not impossible, properly staffing a new studio and developing a game expected to be a AAA Star Wars experience will be challenging. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "James Bond Sean Connery 4K Blu-Ray Box Set On Sale For Lowest Price Yet",
    "description": "The James Bond Collection: 24 Movies (Blu-ray) $55 (was $120) See at Amazon 007: James Bond - Daniel Craig 5-Film Collection (4K Blu-ray) $38 (was $90) See at Amazon 007: James Bond - Sean Connery 6-Film Collection (4K Blu-ray) $71 (was $105) See at Amazon Amazon has a few great box set deals that would make great gifts for James Bond fans this holiday. Most notably, the Sean Connery 6-Film 4K Blu-ray Collection is discounted to $71 (was $105), which is the best deal yet for this classic 007 box set that launched in June. It was featured in Amazon's Cyber Monday sale for $80. For the best value, check out The James Bond Collection, a 24-film Blu-ray box set for only $55 (was $120)--the same deal offered during Cyber Monday. Lastly, The Daniel Craig 5-Film 4K Blu-ray Collection is available for $38, which is only three bucks higher than its Black Friday price. All three box sets will arrive in time for Christmas if you're a Prime member. The James Bond Collection: 24 Movies (Blu-ray) $55 (was $120) The James Bond Collection is a 24-film box set collecting Dr. No (1962) through Spectre (2015). At the current $55 price, you're paying $2.29 per movie. Each film is displayed in 1080p HD and supports DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround sound. Unlike some budget-friendly box sets with a ton of movies, every film in The James Bond Collection is on a separate Blu-ray disc. The movies alone would be a bargain at this price, but The James Bond Collection also comes with over 120 hours of special features. The discs are packaged in a slipcase with three oversized plastic cases. The box comes with a white slipcover featuring each of the six James Bond actors in their title card poses. The only Bond movie from the Eon Productions catalog not featured in this box set is Daniel Craig's final appearance as 007, the 2021 film No Time to Die. Complete your Bond Blu-ray collection: No Time to Die (Blu-ray) -- $10 ($20) No Time to Die (4K) -- $16.57 ($22) See at Amazon 007: James Bond - Daniel Craig 5-Film Collection (4K Blu-ray) $38 (was $90) Alternatively, you could complete your James Bond collection by picking up The Daniel Craig 5-Film Collection on 4K Blu-ray for $38--only $3 more than its Black Friday price. This is a 10-disc set featuring the five most recent Bond films on 4K Blu-ray and 1080p Blu-ray: Casino Royale (2006) Quantum of Solace (2008) Skyfall (2012) Spectre (2015) No Time to Die (2021) The 4K UHD editions of all five movies support Dolby Vision and HDR10. The first three movies have DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, while Spectre and No Time to Die offer Dolby TrueHD 7.1. No Time to Die is also compatible with Dolby Atmos. Hours of behind-the-scenes content from the standalone editions are included on the 1080p Blu-ray discs. The Daniel Craig 5-Film Collection is also available on DVD for $21. Prior to No Time to Die's release, Warner Bros. released 4-Film Collections on Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray. See at Amazon 007: James Bond - Sean Connery 6-Film Collection (4K Blu-ray) $71 (was $105) Until this year, only Daniel Craig's Bond movies were available on 4K Blu-ray. That changed in June with the Sean Connery 6-Film Collection. This is the only one of the three box sets that still comes with digital copies of the movies, but unlike the Daniel Craig Collection, it does not include standard Blu-ray discs. The films were restored in native 4K (2160p) resolution from the original camera negatives. All six movies support Dolby Vision and HDR10 as well as three audio formats: Dolby Atmos, Dolby TrueHD 7.1, and DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 Mono. Special features include optional audio commentaries, various featurettes and retrospectives, and galleries of promotional materials. As mentioned, the current $71 deal is better than the collection's Black Friday price ($80). This collection released in June alongside a Steelbook Library Collection edition that sold out at launch (sadly). See at Amazon 007: James Bond - Sean Connery Movies (4K Blu-ray) In September, all six Sean Connery films from the box set received standalone editions for $30 each. Amazon had most of them for $13-$15 each during Black Friday, but unlike the box set, the prices for these have gone up. Three of the six movies are available for $17 or less, but the other three are just under $24 each. Sean Connery Bond Movies on 4K Blu-ray: Dr. No (1962) -- $17 ($30) From Russia With Love (1963) -- $13.87 ($30) Goldfinger (1964) -- $23.79 ($30) Thunderball (1965) -- $16 ($30) You Only Live Twice (1967) -- $23.69 ($30) Diamonds Are Forever (1971) -- $23.69 ($30) See at Amazon Sean Connery reprised the role of 007 in 1983's Never Say Never Again. It's not in the collection or the list above because it wasn't made by Eon Productions. Never Say Never Again is one of only two Bond movies outside the Eon umbrella. The other was 1967's Casino Royale starring David Niven. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake is discounted to $40 (was $60) on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 at Amazon and Target. The PS5 and Xbox editions are up for grabs for $50, which is the all-time low for those platforms, too. Considering the two-game collection launched October 30, we wouldn't expect the $40 deals to remain in stock for long. You can complete the original trilogy by picking up Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake for $35 on Switch 1/2 or PS5; the Xbox edition is a few bucks cheaper at Amazon. The $35 deal matches Amazon's Black Friday price. Fans should also check out Amazon's 50% discount on the hardcover art book Dragon Quest Illustrations. Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake (Switch 1/2, PS5, Xbox) $40 (was $60) Like all Square Enix games for Switch 2 so far, the Nintendo Switch 2 version is a Game-Key Card that requires a 17GB download. If this bothers you, the Nintendo Switch version has the full game on the card and is fully playable on Nintendo's new console. Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake earned favorable reviews from critics; it holds an 84 Metascore on GameSpot sister site Metacritic. Just like Square's other HD-2D remakes, the first two Dragon Quest games look and run beautifully on all platforms. The updated visuals are bolstered by the new orchestral soundtrack. Square Enix implemented a bevy of welcome gameplay changes to give players more customization options. You'll also find new dungeons, meet new characters, and watch a more cohesive story unfold between the two games and DQIII. The first game is still a solo adventure for the Hero, but a new playable character in the sequel gives you the chance to have a \"modern four-member party. If you're in the mood for a couple of thoroughly retro turn-based RPGs that don't feel like a full-time job, this collection is well-worth checking out. Dragon Quest I can be completed in 10-15 hours, and the sequel is roughly 20 hours. Amazon Deals: Nintendo Switch -- $40 ($60) Nintendo Switch 2 -- $40 ($60) PS5 -- $50 ($60) Xbox Series X -- $50 ($60) Target Deals: Nintendo Switch -- $40 ($60) Nintendo Switch 2 -- $40 ($60) See at Amazon See at Target See at Walmart Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake (Switch 1/2, PS5, Xbox) $35 (was $60) The Nintendo Switch and PS5 editions of Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake are on sale for only $35 at Amazon. The Xbox version is available for $32. The PS5 edition is also available for $35 at Walmart, and the Xbox edition is $35 at Target. Walmart and Target are sold out of copies on the other platforms. Unlike Dragon Quest I &amp; II, this one has a Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade that enhances visuals and improves overall performance. The Switch 2 upgrade can be downloaded for free from the eShop. Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake completed Square Enix's Erdrick Trilogy--also known as Roto/Loto Trilogy--remake project that started last year with Dragon Quest III. The remakes were released in this order, because the third numbered entry actually takes place before DQ1. So if you're interested in trying classic Dragon Quest for the first time, Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is a great place to start. Dragon Quest III was the first entry in the series to feature a job system and emphasize working alongside your companions as a true party. It's also a much larger game, with more places to explore and longer runtime; it takes roughly as long to beat DQIII as it does to clear the first two games combined.

Amazon also has the 1,579-piece Lego Star Wars: Dark Falcon playset for $149 (was $180). The Dark Falcon is the alternate-reality Millennium Falcon from the Rebuild the Galaxy animated miniseries.

The Millennium Falcon is one six Lego Star Wars midi-scale ships released so far. Lego's midi-scale ships are designed for adults and experienced builders due to the number of small pieces and densely packed details. All of the mid-scale ships are priced under $100, but the Millennium Falcon offers the best value--even at full price--from a piece to price ratio. The authentic design includes all of the exterior trappings found on the Millennium Falcon in the movies, including the rectenna dish, quad laser cannon, exhaust vents, the fuel lines, and more. The build process also includes intricate engine and cockpit sections. We've listed all six mid-scale Star Wars starships below.

The Star Wars universe is rearranged when a reality-altering Jedi relic is moved. Heroes and villains swap allegiances, leading to characters such as Darth Jar Jar and Bounty Hunter C-3PO and reskinned starships like the Dark Falcon. The 1,579-piece Dark Falcon playset has a number of interactive features, including spring-loaded shooters, rotating cannons, a removable cockpit, gunner post, and more. The set includes six minifigures: Darth Jar Jar Bounty Hunter C-3PO Darth Dev Darth Rey Beach Luke Jedi Vader All six minifigures have their own accessories, four of which are lightsabers. Notably, Darth Jar Jar, the galaxy's new Sith Lord, wields the double-sided red lightsaber that Darth Maul has in The Phantom Menace. There's even a removable throne for Darth Jar Jar. The gunner post and cockpit can fit two minifigures each. The Dark Falcon building set is 17 x 12.5 x 5 inches. It's classified as a playset and is suitable for builders ages 10 and up, but it makes for a nice display piece.

Nintendo and PlayStation Final Fantasy fans can get the six-game retro collection for $40 (was $75) for Switch and PS4. This is a true physical edition with all six games on the Switch cartridge or PS4 disc, and the collection is fully compatible with Switch 2 and PS5. The Pixel Remasters of the first six mainline Final Fantasy games look and sound great on both platforms, but they feel especially at home on a portable console like the Switch 1/2. The Anniversary Edition come with a Final Fantasy character sprite sticker sheet. Amazon has deals on other remasters and remakes of classic Square Enix RPGs, including the publisher's two biggest retro releases in recent months: Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles is discounted to $40 (was $50) for Switch 1/2 and PS5, and Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake is down to $40 (was $60) for Switch and Switch 2; the PS5 and Xbox editions are discounted to $50. Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition $40 (was $75) for Nintendo Switch &amp; PS4 Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition includes the Pixel Remasters of the following games: Final Fantasy I (NES, 1987) Final Fantasy II (NES, 1988) Final Fantasy III (Famicom, 1990) Final Fantasy IV (SNES, 1991) Final Fantasy V (SNES, 1992) Final Fantasy VI (SNES, 1994) All six games received comprehensive graphical and audio overhauls for the Pixel Remaster series. Square Enix remodeled the sprites using the original pixel art as a foundation. Series composer Nobuo Uematsu supervised the creation of the rearranged soundtracks. You can also play the games with the original soundtracks, but the rearranged versions are great. Numerous quality-of-life features were added, including quick save, customizable text fonts, experience multipliers, auto-battling, the ability to turn off random encounters, and more. You can also browse the in-game bestiary and illustration gallery as well as listen to classic tunes with a music player. The original collection launched in 2023 as a Square Enix Store exclusive, but it sold out incredibly fast. The Anniversary Edition brought the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster Collection to major retailers for the first time last October.
