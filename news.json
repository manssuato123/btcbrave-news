Prolific writer and director Taylor Sheridan is writing the script for the film, with Lone Survivor director Peter Berg attached to direct. Activision had been trying to make Call of Duty movies for years, so why is it finally happening now? Xbox boss Matt Booty told Variety that \"a relationship came about\" between people at Paramount and senior executives working on Call of Duty. \"They felt like they found a partner who understands the game, people who play the game, and shared a vision of what it could be to bring that forward,\" Booty said. Activision originally announced it would make Call of Duty movies through its Activision Blizzard Studios label that was formed in 2015, led by Hollywood producers Stacey Sher and Nick van Dyk, and charged with adapting Activision Blizzard's franchises for film and TV. A Call of Duty movie universe was planned at one point, but, as often happens in Hollywood, nothing ever happened. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "As announced at The Game Awards, Mega Man is officially making his comeback in a new game, Mega Man: Dual Overdrive. Since the franchise began in 1987, the evil Dr. Wiley has been creating robot bosses to challenge Mega Man and keep him from foiling whatever nefarious plans he had. Now, it's your turn to design a robot boss for Mega Man to fight in Dual Overdrive. The Mega Man: Dual Overdrive Robot Design Contest has already begun, but there are some restrictions. Capcom already has a base design in mind for this boss, and it's looking for a Robot Master with a right arm that has \"immense suction powers.\" Starting from the template shared by Capcom, players aged 13 and up are encouraged to put their own spin on this villain. The full details are available on Capcom's site, and entries will be accepted from Japan, North America, South America, Europe, and Asia through January 1, 2026 at 11:59 PM PST. Contestants will have to follow the @Megaman account on X to submit their creations. Capcom's staff will narrow the designs down until they pick the six best entries, and the final winner will be chosen from that group. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "CRKD Nitro Deck 2 Releases Spring 2026 Smokey Black White The Switch 2 is a fun console, but one of its shortcomings is that it's not the most ergonomic device for handheld play. That's where CRKD is looking to switch things up, as the company has announced the Nitro Deck 2 for Switch 2 consoles. Even better, it's compatible with the Switch 1 and is scheduled to launch in Spring 2026 in two colorways: White and Smoke Black. Pricing for these have not yet been revealed. CRKD Nitro Deck 2 Releases Spring 2026 Like the original Nitro Deck, the Nitro Deck 2 is designed to be an all-in-one add-on to the Switch 2. The cradle uses a retractable locking mechanism to ensure a tight fit with Switch consoles, and it replaces the Joy-Cons on the sides. The built-in controllers are contoured to fit more naturally in your hands, and they feature an offset right thumbstick for a more ergonomic feel. The console tablet is now held in place with a retractable locking dial located on the rear. It also comes with a legacy adapter for Switch 1 and Switch OLED consoles, as well as another adapter to enable low-latency wired handheld play. The capsticks on this model aren't Hall Effect sticks, but CRKD claims they can deliver ultra-responsive control, adjustable resistance, and immunity to magnetic interference thanks to a zero-contact design. Programmable back buttons can also be found on the rear of the Nitro Deck 2, which have been expanded to include L2 and R2 buttons. You can also customize the joysticks with swappable tops, and the triggers have been upgraded to tactile Digital Triggers. The cradle is rounded off with a durable metal kickstand and motion control compatibility. When not in use with a Switch console, it can be used as a wireless or wired controller for PC, mobile devices, and smart TVs. Smokey Black White CRKD Nitro Deck 2 If you're looking to get something right away for your Switch 1 console, the current CRKD Nitro Deck and Nitro Deck+ come highly recommended. These are priced from around $50 - $60 each, and they come in a wide variety of colors like black, PAL grey, and a retro-inspired purple. The regular Nitro Deck features full-size Hall Effect analog sticks and triggers, a conventional D-pad, four remappable back buttons, motion controls, rumble, turbo function, curved handles, and is compatible with both the standard and OLED Switch models.

    "description": "It was almost a foregone conclusion, but Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 absolutely crushed it at The Game Awards this year, taking home little polygonal statues for a record-setting number of categories it was nominated for. When the game's director, Guillaume Broche took the stage, he thanked a number of individuals, but he ended his speech by giving a very special thank you to us, the players, not with a speech, but with a rather sizable update for the game that dropped the second he walked on stage to accept the award. Dubbed \"The Thank You Update\", this is no mere costume/weapon set, though there's over a dozen each of those to go find too. This is an all-encompassing update that brings everything from quality-of-life updates--a Picto/Lumina filter, a long-overdue photo mode, and an option to escape from battles, to a completely new area called \"Verso's Drafts,\" with a bunch of new story content, mostly about Verso's childhood, and the final music tracks written by Lorien Testard for the game. You can watch the trailer for it here, but, really, we're very sorry, this is a Jack from Lost situation now; you're gonna have to go back and play. The Thank You Update/patch 1.5.0 is available right now on all platforms. The full patch notes are below: Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The 30% price cut is the best offer yet at any retailer, but the deal probably won't be available for long. Last week, Amazon and Walmart had a limited-time deal that dropped the price to $21.13. Both retailers sold out, and Walmart has yet to restock its inventory. Orders placed today (December 12) are expected to arrive before Christmas. Dark Horse published the hardcover edition of Rosalina's Storybook on November 25. Strangely, it was extremely difficult to preorder a copy from Amazon. For months, restocks at Amazon would disappear in hours, so it's a bit surprising to see such a substantial discount this soon after publication. Revealed alongside Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 for Switch and Switch 2, Rosalina's Storybook has been the No. 1 best-selling new release from Dark Horse since it first appeared on Amazon in September.

Ever since he went viral in 2022 for enthusiastically playing the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 medley on a strange-looking tenor flute, Eustache has been a regular feature of The Game Awards. Each year he seems to get more dedicated airtime during the orchestral section, playing bigger and more unusual flutes. Pedro Eustache playing a strange new flute during the Clair Obscur tribute2025, of course, is no different, with Eustache even getting his own announcement video on The Game Awards' social media pages in the lead up to the show. His appearance in the orchestral section didn't disappoint, with his flute part highlighted through the Death Stranding 2 arrangement, and his part in the Clair Obscur section played on a strange new flute that appears to be made out of PVC pipe.
