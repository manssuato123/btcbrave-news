    "description": "Xbox Wireless Controller – Fallout Pip-Boy $83 (was $99) See at Microsoft Store The second season of Prime Video's Fallout TV series is almost here, and to celebrate, Microsoft has revealed a new Xbox controller that looks like it came straight out of the radioactive wasteland. Currently a timed exclusive through the Microsoft Store, the Fallout Pip-Boy Xbox controller is now available to order for $83 (was $99). If you want to add some flair, you can also customize the controller through the Xbox Design Labs, which lets you choose button styles, upgrade to metallic triggers and D-pads, rubberize the side and back grips, and add an engraving. Xbox Wireless Controller – Fallout Pip-Boy $83 (was $99) Inspired by Vault-Tec's wearable computer, this controller features a black top case, the outer casing of a Pip-Boy, and a bright green Vault Boy icon in the center. The D-pad sports a healthy radioactive glow, and several other design elements replicate the Valued-Added Targeting System from Fallout. Beyond that, this is a standard Xbox wireless controller. It's still the same design that was introduced five years ago, with textured triggers, tactile face buttons, and a very clicky D-pad. These controllers can be powered by AA batteries or a rechargeable battery pack sold separately; they're equipped with an audio jack for wired headphones, and their ergonomic design still makes them very comfortable to use for long stretches. The other great thing about the Xbox controller is that it can be used on multiple platforms, including PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and mobile devices via Bluetooth. See at Microsoft Store Xbox gamers looking for a premium option can grab the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller with a Fallout finish. Priced at $164.58 (was $185), this premium edition of the controller offers adjustable-tension thumbsticks, shorter hair-trigger locks, rubberized grips, and interchangeable components. For more Fallout merchandise, don't miss out on this brand-new bundle that celebrates Fallout: New Vegas' 15th Anniversary. Priced at $155, this is a physical re-release of the beloved open-world RPG and it comes with collectible memorabilia. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "It seems telling that Microsoft and Activision haven't been touting sales numbers for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, a sequel that hasn't been as well-received by players as Black Ops 6 was a year earlier. Regardless, Microsoft has announced that the Call of Duty franchise led the charge on Xbox Game Pass in 2025 in two key categories. On social media, the official account for Xbox Game Pass noted that Call of Duty ranked first for total players and hours in 2025. Specific figures beyond that weren't included in the announcement. In addition to #1 in November, @CallofDuty closed out 2025 as the #1 franchise on Xbox Game Pass for total players and hours all year 🫡Here’s to @CallofDuty &amp; its worldwide community. Season 1 of #BlackOps7 + Call of Duty: Warzone is just getting warmed up. — Xbox Game Pass (@XboxGamePass) December 10, 2025 The timing is interesting because Activision released a statement of its own earlier this week which acknowledged that Black Ops 7 fell short of the mark the publisher set for itself. Furthermore, Activision pledged to refrain from any future CoD year-to-year releases that are direct sequels, as Black Ops 6 and 7 were. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "In 2012, programmer Chris Oberth passed away after a career that spanned from the dawn of video games in the late '70s to the PlayStation 2 era. Now, one of Oberth's unfinished games, Xcavator 2025, has been completed and it's slated for a physical release on the console it was originally intended for: the NES. The Video Game History Foundation--with the permission and support of Oberth's family--found the source code for Xcavator 2025 in Oberth's development archives. It was originally developed by Incredible Technologies Inc., the company behind the Golden Tee Golf and Big Buck Hunter arcade games. However, it was rejected by publishers in 1991, and it was never seen again until now. To finish the game, the VGHF teamed up with Mega Cat Studios, which was guided by the remaining materials to recapture the spirit of Oberth's original vision. Towards that end, Mega Cat Studios' development team only used the tools and environments that would have been available at the time. A standalone trailer for Xcavator 2025 isn't available yet, but the first footage was screened during the Day of the Devs: The Game Awards Edition at the 1 hour 43:31 mark below.

Also known as Overdose, OD is one of several games from Hideo Kojima and his team at Kojima Productions that we know about, and it's being made in partnership with Xbox Game Studios. Kojima has kept most details on OD under wraps, allowing the brief reveal trailer to do the talking for him and get fans of his work speculating on what he's cooking up right now. A few other details on the game have been revealed since it was first announced during the 2023 edition of The Game Awards. Here's a closer look at everything we know about OD so far. When will OD be released? A release date for OD hasn't been revealed yet, and we're expecting this game to be in incubation for a few more years before it sees the light of day. Kojima, who is now in his 60s, is keenly aware that he can only remain active in game development for as long as his body and mind holds out, but the veteran developer has promised to stay creative for as long as he is physically able to do so. OD trailer New Teaser Trailer The most substantial glimpse of the game was shared during a Kojima Productions live-stream in September 2025. In the new teaser trailer, OD’s backstory is shared in glimpses of redacted text that raise more questions than answers. From there, the video follows Sophia Lillis’ character as the events unfold from her first-person perspective. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Rockstar Games' Red Dead Redemption 2 has some moments of levity, but it's not a comedic farce. Or at least it wasn't until a modder found a way to bring the chaotic energy of Super Monkey Ball into game with Arthur as the monkey inside of the ball. YouTube host Blurbs recently fielded requests for Red Dead Redemption 2, including the aforementioned Super Monkey Ball mod. Before it could be finished, Blurbs had to work out how to put Arthur into a ball and and add gyroscopic controls and little bananas for Arthur to collect. But the crowning touch was to let the monkey ball unleash a path of destruction in its wake. I completely recreated Super Monkey Ball inside of RDR2. I asked popular streamers for mod ideas, so blame them. pic.twitter.com/WtltktmxYw — Blurbs (@Blurbstv) December 9, 2025 That was only one of the requests that Blurbs completed for the full video. Some of the others included the creation a gunicorn--a horse with a usable gun attached to their head--as well as a separate gun that can turn NPCs into horses, in addition to birds that target Arthur with their explosive poop. To cap it off, Blurbs activates all of the mods at once, which sends Arthur into Super Monkey Ball mode at very inopportune times. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Berseria follows Velvet Crowe, a young woman bent on vengeance after the murder of her brother. It's a deep, emotional tale of self-reflection and the power of letting go. Despite launching after Zestria, Berseria's prequel story is approachable even if you haven't played Zestria. In fact, like the majority of the Tales series, you can play Tales of Berseria without prior knowledge of the other games. It even seems like Bandai Namco plans for new players to start here, considering Zestria has not been remastered yet. With the cadence of remastered Tales games, it seems to only be a matter of time before Bandai Namco announces a remaster of Tales of Zestiria to give both new fans and veterans alike the complete story with modern improvements.
