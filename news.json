    "description": "Several months have passed since the release of Silent Hill F, and thanks to online chatter, memes, and an active community, the survival-horror game is still trending. That's according to Silent Hill series producer Motoi Okamoto and writer Ryukishi07, who recently spoke about how Silent Hill F continues to stay in the spotlight. \"Recently, discourse about games is being consumed at a rapid pace,\" Okamoto said to Dengeki Online (via Automaton), . \"But games that do get talked about even months after release are the ones that are fun to theorize about and analyze, and they usually get a lot of character fan art.

I think what people might want to hear is: There will be new stuff coming in a reasonable timeframe and not seven years from now.\" Gibson went on to explain that he and Team Cherry co-founder William Pellen \"might have some vague ideas\" for the DLC, but added that he didn't want to \"overpromise\" and underdeliver to the game's fans.

The statistics look highly impressive for the studio's campaign against cheaters, claiming that only 2% of total matches were likely to have been impacted by cheating. Instead of reporting on anticheat by the number of cheaters caught or banned, Battlefield Studios uses a metric it calls \"Match Infection Rate,\" or MIR, calculated around the likelihood that at least one cheater impacted the results of a given match. The studio reports a MIR of just 2% in the week following launch, which means an impressive 98% of matches were cheat-free. In the month following BF6's launch, the MIR has fluctuated a little, but has stayed mostly between 2% and 3%. The studio reports that EA's Javelin Anticheat has blocked more then 2.39 million cheat attempts to date since release--comparably less than the open beta, which saw over 1.2 million cheats blocked in under 10 days.

During the recent Zero Hour finale, Fortnite brought together Superman, Ironman, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the Power Rangers, Invincible, Street Fighter's Chun Li, Mortal Kombat's Scorpion and Sub Zero, and even a giant Homer Simpson for the final battle. Now, Epic Games co-founder Mark Rein is taking a bow and explaining how he helped make it happen. Superman, Iron Man, Invincible, Homer, Godzilla, Optimus Prime, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the Power Rangers, Sub Zero, Scorpion &amp; more team up in an ‘Avengers: Endgame’ style sequence in Fortnite. pic.twitter.com/wROpgDJgdg — DiscussingFilm (@DiscussingFilm) November 29, 2025 In a post on X, Rein noted that he negotiated the deals that brought these characters into Fortnite and acknowledged his \"great legal team.\" But he attributed the willingness to let the crossover happen to the Fortnite developers for winning the trust of the studios. \"It was mostly the vision of our design and development team combined with bravery of our partners that made this all possible,\" wrote Rein. \"Imagine the audacity of what we were asking them to do with their beloved and sacred intellectual property and the trust that required in us! Yet they all came on board and cooperate in ways that continue to delight millions of people every day.

    "description": "Everstone Studios' free-to-play action-adventure-RPG Where Winds Meet is a game that gives over many of its NPC conversations to chatbots. But these NPCs aren't necessarily smarter because they're AI. In fact, players have discovered some easy-to-exploit loopholes in the chat model that convinces NPCs to hand over their side-quest loot or money even when you haven't done anything at all. Players on Reddit noticed that the AI-powered chatbot NPCs often put their emotional responses and actions in parentheses. That led to the discovery that telling an NPC that you did something to fulfill their quest inside of a parentheses will cause the NPC to believe you've already done it. And the game rewards players for that deception by having the NPC hand over whatever item they promised the player for their help. At first, I tried to speak normally to the chatbots, but then I realized you have the power of (divine truth) byu/Proximis inWhereWindsMeet While Everstone may eventually fix that workaround, it's not the only way to mislead the NPCs. Another user on Reddit found that repeating the NPC's last statement as a question can eventually wear it down until it hands over the item. The user called it, \"the Metal Gear method.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Lemay-Comtois went on to explain that while there will still be post-launch content for Shadows, \"It's not a full-on DLC the way a season pass would have had in the previous years ... Any content we want to do in Year Two will probably be more sparse, not a drip-feed... but chunkier updates that shake things up a little more. I'm not announcing anything at this point, but our strategy for Year One was to be quick and reactive, so it means smaller drops often, but for Year Two we don't need to put fires out or anything, so it's more what good, chunky little piece of meat... we can drop and have people come back and enjoy it.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

We've seen some terrific Lego promotions over the past few weeks, including Star Wars models for 50% off, Batmobiles for all-time low prices, Formula 1 and Fast &amp; Furious race car deals, and rare price cuts on Lego Icons models like the awesome Pac-Man Arcade. There are still some fantastic Lego deals available, but there's no guarantee any of them will be available after today (December 1). We've rounded up the best Cyber Monday Lego deals available now. Cyber Monday Lego Deals: Amazon | Walmart | Target | Lego Store | Best Buy Not every Lego deal is explicitly marked as a Cyber Monday deal. This happens most often when Amazon matches a deal from a competitor. As such, Amazon's store page for Lego deals is missing a lot of great offers, so the lists below look different than Amazon's official Cyber Monday Lego hub. Most of the deals in the gallery are at Amazon, but there are some discounted building sets that are exclusive to Walmart or Target. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Fortnite Chapter 7 has totally revamped the Battle Royale loot pool in the new season, and the new arsenal is mostly made up of weapons we've never had before. Likewise, Epic has added a few new types of items that have no real precedent in Fortnite, and some of them are exceptionally powerful. But for this story, the biggest new addition is the boss kits, which drop when you defeat an NPC boss. These kits are locked in your inventory until you win the round or die, make you look like the boss the kit came from, and give you increased health and stamina, and an ability unique to that boss that you have to activate manually by using the item. Oh, and it shows everyone on the map exactly where you are. There are three of these bosses at the moment, and they rotate randomly between five locations: Ripped Tides, Classified Canyon, Painted Palms, and either side of the lake east of Wonkeeland. Without any further ado, let's see what we're working with in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, from the deadly new weapons to the awesome new Self-Revive Kit. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
