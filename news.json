Kai will actually be the subject of the next Lego Pass--buying the pass for 1,400 V-Bucks, or unlocking it via Fortnite Crew, will instantly unlock both the Lego and Fortnite varieties for Kai. Progressing through the pass from there with XP in any Fortnite experience will grant you a number of Ninjago-themed builds that you can use wherever you like in Lego Fortnite Odyssey, or on your home lot in Lego Fortnite Brick Life. The rest of the Ninjago gang will be available in the item shop on Thursday, and you'll be able to buy them individually or in a big bundle that includes all three and their accompanying accessories. Where are Lloyd and Nya, the other two members of the ninja squad from the show? We don't know, but don't count out the possibility they'll be added later--especially since the trailer description teases another major Ninjago update in 2026. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is celebrating its one-year anniversary today, December 9, 2025. Below, we look back at how it uniquely translated the adventurous and comedic spirit of the original movies in video game form. There are several expectations that come with an Indiana Jones video game--it's a legacy franchise and a known quantity, having chugged along across various media since the franchise's inception in 1981. Among the checklist items for any Indy game are whip-swinging traversal, puzzle-solving in exotic locales, and fascist-punching action. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle certainly has all of the expected elements, but studio MachineGames went far beyond what anyone thought an Indiana Jones video game could be. In a post-Uncharted world, it would be hard to blame a AAA studio if it just followed Naughty Dog's cinematic game formula, made Indiana Jones basically Nathan Drake with a fedora, and called it a day with little shame.

Nintendo started rolling out the new system updates for Switch and Switch 2 yesterday, December 8. Both patch notes are the same: \"General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.\" This is also the same language from a Switch 2 update in September, and stability patches have been joked about regarding Nintendo for years at this point. However, last month brought a beefier update to Switch 2 and Switch. Nintendo added better visual clarity on the home menu regarding digital and physical games as well as GameChat improvements, for example. The patch did bring about more stability improvements, too.

    "description": "Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is celebrating its one-year anniversary today, December 9, 2025. Below, we examine how it carried the torch of the classic films to create the best new piece of Indy fiction in decades. Indiana Jones is one of the most revered blockbuster stories of the 1980s. Spielberg and Lucas' work on the original trilogy stands alongside Jaws and Star Wars as timeless classics that are worth revisiting regularly. The more recent entries--the Crystal Skull and the Dial of Destiny--do little to live up to the standard that the first three set. But the game Indiana Jones and The Great Circle brings everything about that original trilogy back, like a careful archaeological dig. It's the true successor to one of the original blockbuster trilogies. As we hit The Great Circle's first anniversary, it is clearer than ever that MachineGames accomplished something the film series has struggled to for the last 20 years. The Great Circle feels like the real successor to The Last Crusade, not because it imitates it beat for beat, but because it understands the core ingredients that make an Indiana Jones story timeless. It is a globe-spanning mystery built on discovery and the thrill of pushing deeper into the unknown. It captures the charm of a character who is smart, stubborn, curious, and always one quip away from a bruised rib. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "AI VTuber Neuro-Sama Finally Completes Hardcore Minecraft, But Some Aren't Happy",
    "description": "When I wrote yesterday about Neuro-Sama attempting to complete Minecraft Hardcore, I never imagined that she would actually cross the threshold a few short hours later and emerge victorious. During a nail-biting seven-hour stream, the AI VTuber ventured into the Nether, discovered a Stronghold, and (mostly) willingly leapt into the End Portal to take on the game's final boss--the Ender Dragon. After days of tense grinding on her creator Vedal987's Twitch channel, Neuro's Minecraft Hardcore attempts became somewhat of a minor phenomenon due to her tendency to react in a way that no human player would. One minute she'd be hyperfocusing on digging straight lines down (like a termite, according to her fellow players Filian and Crelly), and the next she would be drowning in the middle of a lake. I'll be the first to admit I was joining the participants' weary sighs, wondering if it was an achievable feat. Then along came run number 87. Crelly, as Neuro's unofficial new babysitter, spent the majority of the late game distracting Neuro, saving her from death. With a pumpkin atop her head--an Enderman won't attack you for looking at it with a carved pumpkin on your head, at the expense of the majority of your vision--Neuro wandered the overworld with Crelly, building houses, collecting flowers for Vedal, playing games of \"tag,\" and pondering the world's most important questions. \"Do you ever feel like all Vedal cares about is pretzels?\" asked Crelly, while Vedal and Filian were in the dangerous Nether collecting Ender Pearls. \"And it's so weird when he asks us to call him Big Pretzel, like, what is he thinking?\" Neuro responded, before giving Filian and Crelly the nicknames of Milkshake and Big Milk respectively.

    "description": "Since its official launch in 2021, Medieval Dynasty has given players a glimpse of life in the middle ages without any fantasy flourishes. You don't have to worry about dragons, wizards, or orcs killing you in this game, but you still have to survive in some harsh conditions. Now, a free update for Medieval Dynasty is adding some new touches for the game that go beyond mere survival. There were pregnancies and children in this game prior to the Labor of Love update, but there are now more realistic depictions of it including visibly pregnant women, new animations and conversations, as well as a productivity boost for the player during the pregnancy and while the mother takes care of the child. In this game, players go on to play as their children after the death of their characters. Additionally, pregnant women will stop working during their second term. This free update is also accompanied by a paid DLC called The Exquisite Pack. The cosmetic options include two new outfits: a dress and jewelry for a female character and something resembling formal wear for the men. The DLC also gives players an exquisite sword, new hairstyles and mustache designs, as well 13 emblem patterns for players' settlements. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

First seen in the Mojave Desert--and described by TGA host Geoff Keighley as being pure \"regal.inspiring.thickness\" as it stood there--the monolith has now been spotted in Los Angeles. It's not clear if this is the same monolith as the one in the desert or a new one, and there's still no clue what this piece of aura-farming architecture is teasing yet. One franchise that it's probably not linked to? Battlefield, as Battlefield Studios senior director of integrated communications Andy McNamara snapped a photo of the monolith and mentioned that it wasn't linked to EA's FPS franchise. The tease from the desert is now in LA? pic.twitter.com/QLihqwQ9rF — Andy McNamara (@TheRealAndyMc) December 9, 2025 Beyond that, there have been plenty more guesses as to what the demonic monolith will reveal. Some people have speculated that it could be teasing the next Diablo 4 expansion or The Elder Scrolls 6--industry reporter Jason Schreier claims it's not related to either IP--and CI Games CEO Marek Tyminski has confirmed that it's not Lords of the Fallen 2 being hinted at. God of War dev Cory Barlog has also downplayed rumors that the next God of War game is what the monolith is alluding to, and the only surefire way to find out what's behind the magic door will be to tune into The Game Awards this week on December 11 at 4:30 PM PT / 7:30 PM ET.

    "description": "The Lord of the Rings: Barad-dur Lego Set (5,471 Pieces) $400 (was $460) Get deal at Woot See at Best Buy See at Amazon See at Walmart The Lord of the Rings: Rivendell Lego Set (6,167 Pieces) $440 (was $500) Get deal at Woot See at Best Buy See at Amazon See at Lego Store The two largest Lord of the Rings Lego sets are on sale at Amazon-owned retailer Woot. From now until December 12, while supplies last, Lord of the Rings fans can save $60 on the 5,471-piece Barad-dur tower and the 6,167-piece Rivendell Lego set. Both sets are part of the Lego Icons line and almost always sell for full price at major retailers. Woot's Lego deals typically sell out fast; in fact, both of these sets sold out in hours when they were featured in Woot's Black Friday sale last month. Take a look at these massive Lego Lord of the Rings models below. We also added a list of more Lego deals at Woot at the bottom of this story, including The Legend of Zelda: The Great Deku Tree, Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Red Dragon's Tale, and several Star Wars UCS models. The Lord of the Rings: Barad-dur Lego Set (5,471 Pieces) $400 (was $460) This $460 Lord of the Rings set includes 5,471 pieces, and the completed build stretches 32.5 inches high (nearly three feet!). It's a massive and intricately designed kit with numerous modular structures. It's capped off with the Eye of Sauron, which illuminates for added authenticity. While J.R.R. Tolkien never specified the number of floors in Barad-dur, the Lego recreation of the dreary and terrifying structure has five levels. On the main floor, you'll create Gollum's hideout, an armory, and a prison for Orcs with a cage that opens and shuts. Level two has a dining hall and kitchen. The middle floor contains Sauron's throne room. The throne itself has a secret passageway to the Palantir chamber--where Sauron does his magic crystal ball activities--which features several cool Easter Eggs, including a map of Middle-earth. Above the throne room is the Mouth of Sauron's study, and the top floor has the library with a movable ladder. Barad-dur is 17.5 inches wide and 12 inches deep, so you'll need ample shelf space and nearly three feet of open space above for the tower spire. The set comes with 10 minifigures: Sauron Mouth of Sauron Gollum Frodo Baggins Samwise Gamgee (Sam) Gothmog 4 unique Orcs It also includes accessories based on the Peter Jackson film trilogy such as the One Ring, Sauron's mace, light of Earendil, helmets for each Sauron figure, various armor and weapons, and more. Get deal at Woot See at Best Buy See at Amazon The Lord of the Rings: Rivendell Lego Set (6,167 Pieces) $440 (was $500) Lego's recreation of Rivendell is actually even bigger than Barad-dur. At 6,167 pieces, Rivendell is one of the 10 largest Lego sets ever made. Unsurprisingly, it takes up a lot of space, too. The completed build is 28.5-inches wide, 19.5 inches deep, and 15 inches tall. Rivendell is home to 15 Lego minifigures, including all of the members of the Fellowship, Bilbo Baggins, and several other characters: Frodo Baggins Samwise Gamgee (Sam) Gandalf the Grey Meriadoc Brandybuck (Merry) Peregrin Took (Pip) Aragorn Legolas Gimli Boromir Bilbo Baggins Elrond Arwen Gloin 2 Elves This highly detailed model features recreations of rooms from the movie, including Frodo's bedroom and Elrond's study. Rivendell is a modular build, which makes it a good one to piece together with a fellow Lord of the Rings fan; this also means you can remove sections from the main building and display them on different shelves, your desk, etc. This includes the section with the table where the pivotal Council of Elrond scene took place in The Fellowship of the Ring. Lego's model of Rivendell features many authentic trappings and decor from the film, including various paintings, ornate castle spires, the white gazebo, statues, archways, flowers and trees, intricate roof tiling, bridges, an elven forge, and the Shards of Narsil. The paintings and statues nod to historical events in Tolkien's Middle-earth writings. Get deal at Woot See at Best Buy See at Amazon Lego Lord of the Rings: Barud-durGallery Rivendell joined the Lego Icons lineup in 2023. At the time, it was the only Lord of the Rings Lego set available in stores. Rivendell was joined by Barad-dur the following year. In 2025, Lego released two more Lord of the Rings sets. The 2,017-piece recreation of The Shire released in April for $270. Similar to Barad-dur and Rivendell, The Shire comes with a bunch of minifigures--nine, to be exact. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
