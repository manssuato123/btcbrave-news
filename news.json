After initially restocking the Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection with a $165 asking price, Amazon is now selling the large collection of boosters and promo cards for $140. The Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection had sold for as high as $250 before launch and was $211 on launch day (November 14). It launched alongside Pokemon TCG's latest expansion set, Mega Evolution - Phantasmal Flames. Pokemon TCG collectors can also pick up the newly released Mega Venusaur ex Premium Collection for $74.89 at Amazon. Released earlier this month, the latest Mega Pokemon Premium Collection has been difficult to find in stock, so we wouldn't be surprised if it sold out again soon. Speaking of Premium Collections, the Lugia ex &amp; Latias ex Premium Collection is back in stock for $100. Amazon also has a brand-new Pokemon TCG listing that has yet to be noticed by resellers. The Holiday 2025 Poke Ball Tins are available to order for $30 each. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Donkey Kong and Pauline Amiibo $20 (was $30) Get deal at Amazon Donkey Kong fans can grab the Donkey Kong Bananza Amiibo for $20 (was $30) at Amazon right now. This is a Lightning Deal with limited quantities. At the time of writing, over 20% of the available Donkey Kong and Pauline Amiibo figures have been claimed. Amazon also has deals on two Amiibo figures that launched alongside the Nintendo Switch 2: Yunobo from The Legend of Zelda and Jamie from Street Fighter 6 are available for $8 each. Meanwhile, GameStop has all seven Switch 2 Amiibo launch figures for $6 each. The Legend of Zelda: Yunobo Amiibo -- $8 ($30) Street Fighter 6: Jamie Amiibo -- $8 ($40) Donkey Kong Bananza: Donkey Kong and Pauline -- $20 ($30) Donkey Kong and Pauline Amiibo $20 (was $30) Based on DK's wide smile, we imagine he's punching his way to a Banandium Gem. He's also moving fast because Pauline's legs are dangling in the air. The uneven ground beneath DK's feet aligns with rocky terrain found in Ingot Isle, Lagoon Layer, and other locales from the game. As for its functionality in the game, scanning the Donkey Kong and Pauline Amiibo grants two main perks. You can unlock Pauline's Diva Dress a lot earlier in your adventure with the Amiibo. The Diva Dress doubles the likelihood of enemies dropping music discs. To unlock the Diva Dress, you need to talk to the NPC shaped like the Amiibo in the Resort Layer. The NPC will ask you to show them the Amiibo to claim your reward. Without the Amiibo, this particular outfit is locked behind post-game challenges. Scanning the Bananza Amiibo also spawns gold KONG letters that can be smashed to refill Bananergy. KONG tiles can also be spawned by scanning older Donkey Kong Amiibo figures. Get deal at Amazon Nintendo Switch 2 Amiibo Deals at GameStop As mentioned, GameStop is selling all four The Legend of Zelda Switch 2 Amiibo, the three Street Fighter 6 Amiibo, and the Street Fighter 6 Amiibo Card Starter Set for only $6 each as part of its last-minute holiday sale. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo Tulin -- $6 ($30) Sidon -- $6 ($30) Yunobo -- $6 ($30) Riju -- $6 ($30) Street Fighter 6 Amiibo Jamie -- $6 ($40) Luke -- $6 ($40) Kimberly -- $6 ($40) Street Fighter 6 Amiibo Card Starter Set -- $6 ($40) All Donkey Kong Amiibo Figures King K. Rool Amiibo (Donkey Kong) $18 (was $20) Preorder at Best Buy Most Amiibo figures featuring Donkey Kong characters are out of print, but King K. Rool received a Best Buy-exclusive reprint in September. Normally $20, Best Buy is selling the figure for $18. King K. Rool is the priciest preowned Amiibo in the series sold at GameStop, so fans who are interested in adding King K. Rool to their collection should snag one from Best Buy sooner rather than later. GameStop has two older Donkey Kong Amiibo for $18 each and two Diddy Kong Amiibo for $20 each. Amazon also has the Smash Bros. Series Donkey Kong Amiibo for $20, which would be its MSRP if reprinted today. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

But there's at least one publisher that's taken this criticism to heart by switching gears from This may be a welcome development for Nintendo Switch 2 players who hate Game-Key Cards back to cartridges, thanks to the new size options offered by Nintendo. Inin Games shared the news that its upcoming US and European run of R-Type Dimensions III is going to be released on a physical cartridge instead of a Game-Key Cards. The company also cited a recalculation of the production prices as a reason for the change. Apparently it's cheaper to release a game on Game-Key Cards, but the rumored measures taken by Nintendo apparently lowered the price for cartridges as well. Game-Key Cards have been in physical Nintendo Switch 2 game boxes, but those cards don't actually include any game data. Instead, the Game-Key Cards allow the console to download the game from the internet. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Bethesda's space-based game will receive an additional story DLC, it's just a matter of when. Now, a new report suggests that the delay of Grand Theft Auto 6 played a role in Bethesda's decision to push back its next Starfield chapter. According to Windows Central, Bethesda \"felt more comfortable\" about pushing Starfield's second DLC to the first half of 2026 because Microsoft already had a \"busy holiday period\" for 2025 without it. More intriguingly, the same report indicates that Bethesda has already been showing off the new update and DLC behind closed doors to a select group of players. One of the rumored changes is a revamp of the game's space flight systems that will actually make travel feel like a journey instead of a series of loading screens. Other aspects of space travel and exploration are also said to be improved in the new update, and the Creation Engine will reportedly include \"large technical improvements ... that will also carry forward to future games.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

A developer won't be able to use AI to make an entire game, though, and humans will remain essential to the process, he said. \"The benefits are real, they’re meaningful; but it's not a situation--and I'm unaware of such a situation--where AI could 'sit down and make games.'
