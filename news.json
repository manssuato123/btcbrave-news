    "description": "The battle for Warner Bros. may be down to Netflix and Paramount, but the studio has a clear favorite. Earlier this month, Netflix bid $82.7 billion dollars for Warner Bros., jilting Paramount in the process. Paramount responded with a hostile takeover bid of $108.4 billion. Now, Warner Bros. is urging its shareholders to reject Paramount's \"illusory\" offer. \"Following a careful evaluation of Paramount's recently launched tender offer, the Board concluded that the offer's value is inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on our shareholders,\" reads a letter to shareholders from Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr., the chair of Warner Bros. Discovery's board of directors. Although Paramount's offer is higher, Warner Bros.' contends that Paramount's owners, the Ellison family, didn't offer a \"full backstop\" commitment to provide the money to cover its offer and that it can walk away from the transaction without paying any penalty. By comparison, Netflix and Warner Bros. have a $5 billion breakup fee if their deal fails to close or meet regulatory approval. Warner Bros. also contends that the proposed Paramount deal will not be approved by regulators. Regardless, Netflix isn't guaranteed to be approved either. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Tomb Raider is officially coming to iOS and Android devices on February 12, 2026, and it's priced at $20. This version of the game will also include all 12 DLC packs, adding more outfits, upgrades, and a bonus Challenge Tomb. Feral Interactive says the game has been \"expertly optimized\" for smartphones and tablets and will feature a customizable touchscreen interface. Controller support will also feature in this release, and supported devices will offer gyroscopic motion-aiming. You can preorder it now through the iOS App Store, or you can pre-register for it on the Google Play Store if you're using an Android device. Tomb Raider was a big hit when it arrived more than a decade ago, as it chronicled Lara Croft's first big adventure on the mysterious island of Yamatai. Two sequels followed it, Rise of the Tomb Raider and Shadow of the Tomb Raider. The franchise is also poised for a comeback, as two new games were revealed during The Game Awards.

    "title": "One Of 2025's Best Games Looks Like It's Coming To Switch 2",
    "description": "Down under may have just given us the down low on Dispatch coming to Switch and Switch 2. That's because the Nintendo storefront for Australia has listings up for the episodic game, revealing that the title is planned to launch January 29 on both Nintendo systems. There hasn't been an official announcement from Dispatch developer AdHoc Studio yet about Switch and Switch 2 ports. However, the official Nintendo eShop pages point to this being a matter of when, instead of if, Dispatch arrives on the hybrid consoles. So far, Dispatch is only available on PC and PS5. The Nintendo store listings note that there will be a free Switch 2 upgrade for Dispatch. That edition of the game sports \"enhanced resolution and improved frame rates\" and will take up an estimated 14.6GB of storage space. The listed price is $43.95 AUD--with a launch discount--but keep in mind Australian prices are usually higher than in the US. For example, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on Switch 2 is $109.95 AUD. In comparison, Dispatch costs $30 on Steam and PS5. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Since then, FIFA has been absent from the video game scene, but today Netflix Games and Delphi Interactive have announced that they will be bringing officially branded FIFA soccer back in a new game slated to launch in 2026. The unnamed FIFA soccer game will be available via the Netflix app on both iOS and Android devices, and it is planned to launch \"this summer,\" just in time for the FIFA World Cup 2026. The official announcement calls the new game a \"newly reimagined FIFA football simulation game,\" but no other details were provided. FIFA and Netflix Games\"This major collaboration is a key milestone in FIFA’s commitment to innovation in the football gaming space, which aspires to reach billions of football fans of all ages everywhere in the world and will be redefining the pure notion of simulation games,\" FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in the offical announcement. \"Our reimagined game truly marks the beginning of a new era of digital football.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

For his part, Straley said \"NPCs are AI\" and have been for decades already in gaming.

    "description": "Circana released its monthly sales report for November today, shining a light on how the North American video game business is performing. Hardware sales had a particularly difficult month, with sales falling 27%, from $949 million in November 2024 to $695 million in November 2025. November 2025 represented the lowest hardware spending total for a November month since November 2005 ($455 million). A total of 1.6 million game hardware units were sold in North America for November 2025, and that's the lowest since November 1995 (1.4 million units). While total unit sales dropped, the average price paid for a new game console reached a new record high for a November month, rising to $439, up 11% compared to November 2024. The higher average selling price is connected to the price increases that companies like Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, and others have implemented this year due to tariffs and other factors.

    "description": "It's no secret that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 hasn't sold as well as 2024's Black Ops 6, and now Circana has released more sales data that speaks to the performance of the military shooter. Black Ops 7 was the No. 1 best-selling game in North America for November, but the Call of Duty franchise experienced a double-digit percent decrease for full-game dollar sales compared to November 2024. Last year's game, Black Ops 6, was released in October. Despite the sales downturn, this marks the 18th straight year that a new Call of Duty game has ranked No. 1 for its launch month. For anyone keeping score, that streak began with 2008's Call of Duty: World at War. Black Ops 7 is now the No. 7 best-selling game of 2025 so far, with EA's Battlefield 6 continuing to rank No. 1 for the year. For November, Black Ops 7 was No. 1, followed by Battlefield 6, NBA 2K26, Madden NFL 26, and EA Sports FC 26 rounding out the top five for the month. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Back in July, Turn 10 Studios was hit with massive layoffs, and players noticed that new content for the game had begun to slow down. In August, Turn 10 said that it still planned to support Forza Motorsport with several events, but these quickly dried up toward the end of 2025. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
