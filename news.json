However, a week before the new content drops, fans will get a glimpse into the expansion's story with the prequel novel Diablo IV: The Lost Horadrim. This official novel launches on April and will provide context for the Lord of Hatred's main questline and introduce the Skovos Isles region where the expansion takes place. If that sparks your interest, you can preorder the paperback edition of Diablo IV: The Lost Horadrim for $30 at Amazon. The book will also be available as an eBook and Audible audiobook, priced at $15 and $17.52, respectively. Diablo IV: The Lost Horadrim (Novel) $30 | Releases April 21, 2026 Diablo IV: The Lost Horadrim is set in the wake of the cataclysmic reaping by the Angel of Death, Malthael, which leaves humanity and the world of Sanctuary devastated. In an effort to fight against the rising tides of Hell's forces, the Horadric Order sends Lorath, Donan, and Tyrael to the Skovos Isles to uncover the fate of a long-lost expedition. The book's events will tie into the upcoming Diablo IV expansion, Lord of Hatred. It is written by Matthew J. Kirby, who previously wrote the Diablo character tomes for Lorath and Prava. See at Amazon Diablo has a long history in print, and if you're looking to grab a few books--possibly as a devilish stocking-stuffer--there's plenty to choose from. The Diablo art books and character tomes are fun dives into the game's bleak world, combining high-quality prints with rich illustrations to create eye-catching works of art. The character tomes are designed to be in-universe books written from the perspectives of several key Diablo characters, like Cain and Prava, and they use special paper to give each book a worn, weathered look. The first four of these books are also available as part of the Horadric Vault series for $98.39, but it's actually cheaper to purchase each one and the recently released Book of Prava individually. You can also dive into various novels set within the timeline of the first Diablo game. The Sin War is a three-book series covering the conflict that would forever change the destiny of humanity, while Storm of Light is set during Diablo 3 and follows Tyrael as he enacts his boldest plan yet: rebuilding the Horadric Order and preparing them to steal the black Soulstone from the heart of Heaven. Diablo graphic novels are also available for purchase, with two of them chronicling the adventures of two legendary characters from the game series: the legendary Necromancer Rathma and the progenitor of the Barbarians, Bul-Kathos.

    "description": "Nintendo has been known to vigorously defend its interests and intellectual properties in court, and one of its longest-running legal battles may be nearing its conclusion. In 2010, the Japanese video game publisher filed a suit in Germany against BigBen Interactive--the previous incarnation of Nacon--over its third-party Wii Remote controllers. Now, the latest ruling has unequivocally gone in Nintendo's favor. As reported by Games Fray, the Mannheim Regional Court has reaffirmed the ruling that Nintendo is owed damages of over €4 million plus interest. Because Nacon fought the ruling, that interest has increased the total fee to just under €7 million. Nintendo's contention was that Nacon's Wii Remote infringed on its patents for the sensor technology and camera needed to track player movements, as well as an acceleration sensor, and \"the ergonomic features characteristic of Nintendo's Wii Remote.\" The initial verdict came down in 2011, but Nacon has consistently appealed the judgment and come up empty each time.

On TV, Isaacs recently had a starring role in the The White Lotus Season 3, a role that earned him his first Emmy nomination. The Tomb Raider TV show stars Game of Thrones alum Sophie Turner as Lara Croft, with Avatar's Sigourney Weaver signed on to play a character named Wallace.

It was \"wonderful and genuinely one of the most creatively exciting times of my life.\" However, she said she was and remains concerned that Tomb Raider could fall apart, given that Perfect Dark was canceled. \"I just felt so relieved that I still had Lara, but I also felt really frightened about losing Lara.

The Bloomberg report said that beginning in late October, Naughty Dog asked staff to work \"a minimum of eight extra hours a week\" and document their overtime in a spreadsheet. \"This overtime period was an attempt to get the production back on track after several missed deadlines,\" the report said. Workers were told to not work more than 60 hours per week, the report said. The return-to-office mandate was disruptive to some workers who reportedly had to find cover for childcare and their pets. The report added that the \"mandated overtime\" period wrapped up this week with the completion of the demo. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
