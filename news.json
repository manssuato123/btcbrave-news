The new season of Fallout debuts on Prime Video later this month, and you can check out the classic games that inspired it, starting December 23.

After facing an uphill battle since launch, Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus just received its first major update, making it a great time to give the game a try. As a reminder, all of the free games that you claim through Prime are yours to keep forever, even if your subscription expires. If you aren't a member yet, you can sign up for Amazon Prime for as little as one month to take advantage of the subscription and its freebies. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "PSVR 2 Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle $299 (was $400) See at Amazon See at PS Direct See at Walmart See at Best Buy See at Target See at GameStop PSVR 2 PC Adapter $60 See at Amazon See at PS Direct See at Best Buy See at Walmart See at Target See at GameStop There's never been a better time for PS5 owners to add the PlayStation VR 2 to their entertainment center. As part of PlayStation's Holiday Sale, the PSVR 2 Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle is on sale for only $299 at Amazon/Walmart and $300 at PS Direct and other major retailers. Officially, this is a $100 discount, but at the start of 2025, this bundle still carried its original $600 price point. PlayStation permanently dropped the price of the PSVR 2 to $400 in February, and the current deal is the best ever for the impressive virtual reality headset for PS5 and PC. This deal runs through December 18 while supplies last. If you don't yet own a PlayStation 5, you can also save $100 on several different models, including the PS5 Pro, the new PS5 Slim Fortnite Bundles, and even the Ghost of Yotei Limited Edition Bundle with black or gold artwork. If you have a powerful enough gaming PC, you don't actually need a PS5; the PSVR 2 can play SteamVR games if you have the official $60 adapter. PSVR 2 Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle $299 (was $400) This PSVR 2 bundle comes with the headset, two PlayStation Sense Controllers, and a pair of wired earbuds, and a USB-C cable--everything you need to connect and play on PS5. Inside the box, you'll also find a voucher for Horizon Call of the Mountain, one of the platform's most impressive technical showpieces. From a tech perspective, the PSVR 2 is a marked improvement over its predecessor. The the headset has 2000 x 2040 resolution OLED lenses, a 110-degree field of view, eye tracking, 90/120Hz refresh rates, four cameras, and six-axis motion sensing. PlayStation's Sense Controllers utilize the immersive haptics and adaptive triggers found in the PS5 DualSense Controller. It also offers 3D Audio with games that support it. The PSVR 2 isn't wireless like Meta's headsets, but you only need to use one USB-C cable to use it--a stark contrast to the mess of cords needed to operate the PSVR on PS4. Despite its impressive tech, the headset hasn't garnered as wide of an audience as PlayStation likely had hoped. This is apparent when looking at the relatively small lists of upcoming games at any given time. PlayStation itself has only published a few games for the platform, though there are some notable AAA PS5 games with cool PSVR 2 modes, including Gran Turismo 7 and the Resident Evil 4 remake. That said, the PlayStation VR 2 does have a pretty big library thanks to ports of VR games from other platforms. The PlayStation Store has more than 350 compatible games. The library expands exponentially if you have a VR-compatible PC and the accessory below. See at Amazon See at PS Direct See at Walmart PSVR 2 PC Adapter $60 PlayStation added PC support to the PSVR 2 last year, which instantly made the headset one of the most enticing options for PC players. To connect the headset to a gaming PC, you need the PSVR 2 PC Adapter. Once you have the adapter, you can download the free PSVR PC app from Steam to start playing PC VR. The adapter effectively adds thousands of paid and free SteamVR games to the. PlayStation VR2's library. Just make sure your PC meets the minimum specs for VR, as outlined by PlayStation: Operating system: Windows 10 64-bit/Windows 11 64-bit Processor: Intel Core i5-7600 / AMD Ryzen 3 3100 (Zen 2 or later architecture is required) RAM/memory: 8GB or more GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 or later (Turing or later architecture is required) -NVIDIA RTX series-AMD Radeon RX 5500XT or later/AMD Radeon RX 6500XT or later DisplayPort: DisplayPort 1.4 (must have a standard DisplayPort or Mini DisplayPort out port) USB: Direct connection only Bluetooth: Bluetooth 4.0 or later See at Amazon See at PS Direct See at Best Buy Black Friday PlayStation Hardware Deals PlayStation's 2025 Holiday Sale also includes deals on DualSense Wireless Controllers, the PlayStation Portal Remote Player, Pulse Explore Earbuds and the Pulse Elite Headset, and a bunch of first-party games. The PS5 console deals run through December 24, but the other hardware deals end December 18. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "For the last couple of years, the Epic Games Store has given away free games every week through its PC storefront. With the company having launched its own mobile store, it has also started a second free games program on iOS and Android devices, kicking things off with a curated library of titles and weekly freebies. The app also features mobile versions of Fortnite, Fall Guys, and Rocket League Sideswipe. To access these games you will need to create a free Epic account and install the free Epic Games Store mobile app and log in with your account, but once you do, you can start claiming your free games every Thursday through it. One other thing to note is that Android users can access the app via Android-based emulation devices like Retroid Pocket, as they aren't limited to just smartphone and tablets. Download the Epic Games Store Mobile app For now, only iOS users in the European Union can install the app, but the app is available worldwide to Android device users and they have a wider selection of games to choose from in comparison. Like its PC counterpart, you'll have one week to grab each game that's offered. Here's a closer look at what you can grab this week, and what the current mobile games library has to offer. You can also explore what the free PC games are this week on the Epic Games Store. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Terrorist attacks are regularly simulated within Roblox, something Europe's law enforcement agency Europol had uncovered in a November 2025 investigation. Meanwhile, queerness and queer content, regardless of its positivity, is banned in Russia for being \"extremist.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Case in point: Circana senior director Mat Piscatella has revealed that the cube console focused on motion controls has topped every single PS5 and Xbox SKU for units sold in the US for a holiday week. Nex Playground - The Active Play System $249 See at Amazon See at Walmart See at Target See at Best Buy On BlueSky, Piscatella posted the possibly shocking video game hardware statistics for the week ending November 22. The top-selling hardware option was Switch 2 bundled with Mario Kart World, with the Nex Playground at No. 2. Meanwhile, the PS5 Slim digital edition with 1TB came in third place. Obviously, there are multiple options when choosing a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S--various bundles and hard drive configurations--and each one represents a SKU. So one caveat with Circana's info is that the list isn't showing overall Switch 2, PS5, or Xbox Series X|S units sold. US best-selling hardware SKUs for week ending Nov 22, 2025, ranked on units sold: 1) NS2 Mario Kart World Bundle 2) NEX Playground Interactive Gaming System 3) PS5 Slim Digital 1 TB So that's neat.

That might not be much just taken on its own. After all, players have held unofficial role-play weddings in WoW since its earliest days.
