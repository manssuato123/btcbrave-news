Inin Games shared the news that its upcoming US and European run of R-Type Dimensions III is going to be released on a physical cartridge instead of a Game-Key Cards. The company also cited a recalculation of the production prices as a reason for the change. Apparently it's cheaper to release a game on Game-Key Cards, but the rumored measures taken by Nintendo apparently lowered the price for cartridges as well. Game-Key Cards have been in physical Nintendo Switch 2 game boxes, but those cards don't actually include any game data. Instead, the Game-Key Cards allow the console to download the game from the internet. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Bethesda's space-based game will receive an additional story DLC, it's just a matter of when. Now, a new report suggests that the delay of Grand Theft Auto 6 played a role in Bethesda's decision to push back its next Starfield chapter. According to Windows Central, Bethesda \"felt more comfortable\" about pushing Starfield's second DLC to the first half of 2026 because Microsoft already had a \"busy holiday period\" for 2025 without it. More intriguingly, the same report indicates that Bethesda has already been showing off the new update and DLC behind closed doors to a select group of players. One of the rumored changes is a revamp of the game's space flight systems that will actually make travel feel like a journey instead of a series of loading screens. Other aspects of space travel and exploration are also said to be improved in the new update, and the Creation Engine will reportedly include \"large technical improvements ... that will also carry forward to future games.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The Witcher and Cyberpunk developer CD Projekt Red is the latest company to sound off on the use of AI in gaming. During CD Projekt Red's latest earnings briefing, Joint CEO Michał Nowakowski said there are \"meaningful\" and \"real\" benefits to using the technology. The company is already implementing such technologies \"mainly in the productivity areas\" and so far that's where the \"largest benefits\" have stemmed from, he explained, as reported by GamesRadar. A developer won't be able to use AI to make an entire game, though, and humans will remain essential to the process, he said. \"The benefits are real, they’re meaningful; but it's not a situation--and I'm unaware of such a situation--where AI could 'sit down and make games.' That's our take. It doesn't mean it's not gonna be useful, but it's not gonna be making The Witcher 5, or 6, or anything like that,\" Nowakowski explained. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Amazon Prime members can get Bravely Default HD Remaster for $30 (was $40). This is a limited-time Lightning Deal. Bravely Default originally released on Nintendo 3DS in Japan in 2012. An expanded version of Flying Fairy arrived in North America in 2014, so the Switch 2 edition is technically the third iteration of the thoroughly nostalgic turn-based RPG. Bravely Default is one of the best games from the Nintendo 3DS era, and the remaster is great for newcomers and returning players alike. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

At The Game Awards, the game's first villain--the pirate king Bawma--was revealed, along with confirmation that actor and musician Lenny Kravitz will assume the role.
