    "description": "It may come as no surprise that Valve has invested in emulation tech for Arm-based hardware, having just announced its first device running an Arm chip. But beyond its own hardware, Valve's support of open-source emulation projects may have laid the groundwork for playing your favorite PC games on Arm devices like mobiles and tablets--no ports necessary. Valve's upcoming Steam Frame headset is the company's first Arm-based device, making use of the open-source FEX emulator to run Windows-native games. As it turns out, Valve has had more of a hand in FEX's development than it initially appeared. In an interview with The Verge, Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais revealed that Valve actually initiated the FEX project, and has been largely responsible for its development. \"We were talking with a few developers that we knew were the right fit for an undertaking like that, a long-term thing that needed a very specific set of experts,\" Griffais explained. \"We worked hard on trying to convince these guys to start the project, and have been funding them ever since.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Majority Control Of EA Could Shift To Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund - Report",
    "description": "In September, Electronic Arts revealed that there's a $55 billion deal in place to bring the company private under Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, the private equity firm Silver Lake, and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. Now, a new report indicates that the PIF may be given near complete control of the company, because Saudi Arabia is putting up most of the money to complete the deal. According to The Wall Street Journal, EA's potential buyers have disclosed that PIF would be given 93.4% of EA in a document filed with Brazil's antitrust regulator. Silver Lake would only own 5.5% of the company, while Affinity would have a much smaller share: 1.1%. PIF is also a major investor in both Silver Lake and Affinity, which would leave it with more power over EA. WSJ notes that sovereign-wealth funds like the PIF normally make much smaller investments in buyouts like this one, while private-equity firms would take the lead as the primary owners and investors. Saudi Arabia has already invested in several video game companies, including Nintendo and Take-Two Interactive. In this year alone, Saudi Arabian-owned mobile developer Scopely purchased Niantic's video game division, the company behind Pokemon Go and other mobile titles. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Last summer, Sony filed a lawsuit against Tencent over Light of Motiram, a game that the former alleges is a \"slavish clone\" of the Horizon franchise. Now, the two sides have apparently struck a temporary deal ahead of an important court hearing that may determine whether the case goes forward. As reported by The Game Post, a new filing in court acknowledges that Sony and Tencent have been \"engaged in discussions in order to resolve the current dispute.\" Most notably, Tencent asked for more time to respond to the motion for an injunction, and Sony agreed in exchange for certain concessions. The terms call for Tencent to pause all public promotion or testing for Light of Motiram while also agreeing not to argue in court that Sony delayed its request for emergency relief by granting the extension. The filing also notes an agreement between the two sides that Tencent won't ask for expedited discovery in connection with the preliminary injunction against Light of Motiram. It also calls for Tencent to hold the game to its Q4 2027 release window rather than moving it up. Finally, the court document revealed another area where Tencent and Sony see eye-to-eye. The two sides jointly requested that a hearing for Tencent's motion to dismiss and a second hearing held for Sony's injunction request be held on the same day: January 29, 2026.

    "title": "Stranger Things Made A Mistake With An Old School Game... Or Did It?",
    "description": "Stranger Things returned for Season 5 Vol. 1 last month, and the series is taking one last bow in the '80s before concluding later in December. Usually, the show is pretty sharp about not making major mistakes in the time period or anachronisms that shouldn't be there. But this time, the show made an apparent goof with an old-school Nintendo game. As spotted on Time Extension, Hawkins' latest home-grown bully, Derek Turnbow (Jake Connelly), was playing the notoriously difficult Ghosts 'n Goblins on his NES. However, the version of the game playing on the screen was actually the original arcade game that was released by Capcom in 1985. I love Stranger Things, but Season 5 just committed a cardinal sin. They show a kid playing ‘Nintendo’ in his room… but the TV is clearly running the arcade version of Ghosts ’n Goblins, NOT the NES port. My retro heart can’t take it! 😫 pic.twitter.com/LRZJOOjCTM — My Retro Life (@myretrolifeshow) November 29, 2025 On the face of it, this seems like an easy mistake to make for anyone who didn't grow up in the '80s. That said, it's also possible that this isn't a mistake and the arcade version of Ghosts 'n Goblins was used on-screen because it's simply a better looking version of the game.
