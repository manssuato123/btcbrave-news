Others do not believe it is connected to Diablo. Some think it's for the next God of War game. Still others think it could be for The Elder Scrolls 6. All of these suggestions may be wrong, however. On November 28, Keighley posted the tex \"regal.inspiring.thickness\" along with an image of some kind of huge carving featuring humanoid people in the middle of a desert. On November 29, Keighley followed up with a Google Maps image showing the location of the marketing monolith in the California desert. People quickly found the spot and posted images and video, including the ones below. Then on December 5, Keighley posted yet another teaser, this one also very puzzling.

Though Nintendo has never quite said it overtly, it has seemed likely that this is meant to launch a new series of Prime games--possibly even a second trilogy, for the sake of dramatic rhyme. And the ending of Prime 4 accents that feeling, leaving the door wide open for more story--but in the process, diminishing the character of protagonist Samus Aran. Spoilers for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond follow. As many eager Metroid fans know from preview coverage and reviews, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond features a wide cast of Federation characters, who have been stranded on Viewros with Samus. As you explore the corners of Sol Valley you eventually meet five in total: engineer Myles MacKenzie, sniper Reger Tokabi, Sergeant Ezra Duke, Private Nora Armstrong, and mech unit VUE-995. Each talks with Samus and relates to her in different ways. Myles is out of his element and needs Samus' rescue. Armstrong is a bona fide Samus superfan. Tokabi opens up to her about his religion and upbringing. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Appearing on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Huang talked about how, back in the 1990s, he and his two co-founders were trying to drum up business for their start-up PC company. They traveled to Japan and pitched Sega management on the idea that Nvidia could build the company's Dreamcast console. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Earlier this week, Running With Scissors unveiled a new look at Postal: Bullet Paradise, a Postal spin-off developed by Goonswarm Games as a Vampire Survivors-like shooter. However, fan backlash against the alleged AI elements in Bullet Paradise have led Running With Scissors to cancel the game entirely. \"After revealing Postal: Bullet Paradise, a title Running With Scissors was planning on publishing--but not developing--we've been overwhelmed with negative responses from our concerned Postal Community,\" said Running With Scissors founder Vince Desi in a statement. \"The strong feedback from them is that elements of the game are very likely AI-generated and thus has caused extreme damage to our brand and our company reputation.\" Desi noted that Running With Scissors has lost trust in Goonswarm Games, which is why the project has now been killed. Subsequently, Goonswarm Games issued a statement to PC GamesN in which the studio denies using AI in either the game or the trailer shown above. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Developed in collaboration with Joya Studios, the Vice candle comes in a frosted white glass with the Rockstar Games logo and has notes of lemon California, yerba mate, thyme, fig leaf, petitgrain, orange oil, and terpenes. Your nose may also notice notes of tuberose, mimosa, jasmine petals, lily, lotus, cyclamen, wild grass, and raspberry blossom. Beyond those, the candle also contains notes of Texas Cedarwood, galbanum, and smoked patchouli. All the new Rockstar products for the holidays.There is also a \"Liberty\" candle that comes in a frosted black glass with notes of blood orange, black pepper, green cardamom, cedar, and clove leaves. The burn time for these candles is about 65 hours, Rockstar said, or just under $1 per hour if you want to look at it that way. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Metroid Prime 4: Beyond isn't a Switch 2 exclusive, but how it would run on the OG Switch has remained a mystery through its entire announcement and preview cycle. The preview coverage has consistently been running on Switch 2, and review codes were for the Switch 2 Edition, so many reviews including ours evaluated that version. Now that the game is out, though, we can put any lingering concerns to rest: The game plays smoothly on the original Switch. For the purposes of this look at the game I replayed through the first two major sections: the tutorial mission with the assault on the Galactic Federation, and then the Fury Green portion on Viewros where Samus first starts to unlock her psychic abilities. Predictably, the Switch 1 version looks noticeably lower-quality than its Switch 2 counterpart, with less-detailed textures and lighting effects. It still looks decent, though, and compares favorably to the Metroid Prime Remaster that was released on Switch in 2023. Just know that you shouldn't go in expecting it to look quite as nice as the official trailers or other footage captured on a Switch 2. Its performance, on the other hand, is very good. It doesn't offer a Quality or Performance mode selection like it does on Switch 2, but the default settings run well, without noticeable framerate dips. Switch fans who have watched recent Nintendo games outpace the hardware's limitations, especially in the cases of some recent Pokemon and Zelda titles, can be assured that isn't the case here. In my limited testing, I didn't run into any hitches, and felt the smooth performance was roughly on par with my review experience on Switch 2. It's possible, of course, that later portions may overwhelm the system, but I haven't had any cause for concern so far. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Rainbow Six Siege celebrated its 10th anniversary this month, a milestone that many live-service games haven't come close to matching. The tactical shooter launched in 2015, and it has evolved into a major attraction at esports tournaments across the globe, reaching 85 million players to date. To keep things fresh, Rainbow Six Siege's \"most transformative\" update yet went live earlier this year, prompting a surge of new and veteran players to hop into the game. But will we ever see Rainbow Six Siege 2? Speaking to GameSpot, creative director Alexander Karpazis doesn't expect a sequel anytime soon, as Ubisoft aims to respect players' investment and keep the current game going for the foreseeable future. \"Honestly, I think there are tons of reasons against it, just like there are reasons for it,\" Karpazis said. \"But for us, it's about maintaining something that has been successful and competitive and fun for such a long time. We see it where players kind of get the rug pulled out from under them, and everything they've worked towards kind of changes in an instant when they jump over to a sequel. And that's something we don't want to do to our players. So there's an element of respecting players' investment. There's also an element of, this is an amazing legacy we're building--why would we want to throw that away?\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Now the game is preparing to dive back in with the In The Jungle expansion in early 2026. The DLC will see Dave and his crew heading to a new freshwater biome and catching lake-dwelling creatures to make their dishes. GameSpot spoke with Mintrocket CEO and Dave the Diver game director Jaeho Hwang about the upcoming expansion, how the studio has responded to the game's success, and the delicious research that goes into making a game all about food. GameSpot: What was the genesis of the \"In the Jungle\" concept? What was the team trying to achieve with this new biome?
