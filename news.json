Today, the RPG changes from \"D+D-like\" to simply \"D+D,\" as Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked, in partnership with Wizards of the Coast, launches on PS5, PC, and VR platforms. Battlemarked lets up to four players join together in one of two campaigns set in the Forgotten Realms, with each player choosing between six classes: Bard, Fighter, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, and Sorcerer. Persistent character progression will allow players to level up and set ability points as they see fit, and those characters will not reset once the campaign has ended, so players can choose them as much as they like.

The app also features mobile versions of Fortnite, Fall Guys, and Rocket League Sideswipe. To access these games you will need to create a free Epic account and install the free Epic Games Store mobile app and log in with your account, but once you do, you can start claiming your free games every Thursday through it. One other thing to note is that Android users can access the app via Android-based emulation devices like Retroid Pocket, as they aren't limited to just smartphone and tablets. Download the Epic Games Store Mobile app For now, only iOS users in the European Union can install the app, but the app is available worldwide to Android device users and they have a wider selection of games to choose from in comparison. Like its PC counterpart, you'll have one week to grab each game that's offered. Here's a closer look at what you can grab this week, and what the current mobile games library has to offer.

Other reports suggest that the next Fortnite map \"will begin with a distinctive Los Angeles flavor and will have a desert biome.\" Since Epic is spelling out the word \"seven\" for this chapter, it's led to speculation that The Seven--a team of heroes who used to appear in Fortnite--may finally get their comeback.

    "description": "World of Warcraft's upcoming Midnight expansion is bringing sweeping changes to the MMORPG's transmog system, but they look to be far more expensive than players were led to believe. Earlier this year when Midnight was fully revealed, developer Blizzard announced it would be overhauling the game's cosmetic outfit system in a way that would save players gold. Instead of having to pay gold to transmog individual gear pieces, players would instead transmog gear slots. That slot would then retain its appearance regardless of whatever item was equipped, useful as players level up and equip new gear over the course of an expansion or season. Sounds good on paper. However, the system is now testable on the WoW: Midnight beta, and as broken down by Wowhead, players are discovering these supposedly cost-saving changes are actually extremely expensive.

It also includes a welcomed surprise for duck collectors. The most notable change in this Arc Raiders update is the nerf to the game's powerful Venator pistol. The developer says it was aware that the fully upgraded Venator was over-performing and \"capable of outgunning full squads using close-range weapons.\" The gun's nerf includes a reduction to the fire rate gained from upgrades, and it also receives an increase in weight. The developer says the weapon's weight was not previously in line with the other pistols in the game, so the weight was increased from 2 to 5. Another major nerf in the update affects the game's powerful Deadline mine. Players have been taking down the game's largest Arc enemies with the Deadline mines, and the developer seems to think it's been too easy to utilize, as the update makes it harder to obtain the mines. The buy value of the Deadline has been increased from 8,100 to 15,000 Coins, the crafting materials needed have also increased, and traders will now carry less stock of the mine.
