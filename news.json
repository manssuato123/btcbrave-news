The best deal is on the current priciest set in the collection. The 540-piece Super Sonic vs. Egg Drillster is up for grabs for $64 (was $80) at Amazon and the Lego Store. Five other Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets will be disappearing from major retailers soon, including the only Sonic the Hedgehog Lego set designed for adults and experienced builders. If you want to display Shadow the Hedgehog's head on your shelf, the 740-piece model is on sale for $56 (was $70) at Target. Shadow the Hedgehog is exclusive to Target and the Lego Store--it's still priced at $70 directly from Lego--so deals on this set are even less common than on the Lego Sonic products with wider availability. We've rounded up more Lego Sonic the Hedgehog deals at the bottom of this story. Lego Sonic: Super Sonic vs. Egg Drillster (590 Pieces) $64 (was $80) | Retiring Soon Super Sonic vs. Egg Drillster is one of the coolest playsets in Lego's Sonic the Hedgehog lineup. The 590-piece building set has a bunch of interactive components and features seven characters, including three minifigures: Super Sonic, Shadow, and Dr. Eggman. Two of the characters--Pocky and Pecky--are minifigure accessories for Shadow and Super Sonic to hold. The remaining two characters are small buildable figures of Egg Pawn Badnik and reprogrammed Gun Wing. Dr. Eggman's Egg Drillster vehicle is the largest portion of the build. The movable vehicle measures 9.5 x 5 x 3 inches and has a rotating drill as well as a dock for Gun Wing. The set also has a small laboratory build with a desk, minifigure chair, and a destructible wall. You can knock down the wall with the vehicle's spinning drill or by using the buildable speed sphere launcher piloted by Super Sonic or Shadow.

Discotek Media's Digimon The Movies 4-6 Collection releases December 30. The preorder price has dropped for the second time at Amazon and Crunchyroll; the $30 Blu-ray collection is now available to preorder for only $20. The 4-6 Collection is a follow-up to Discotek Media's popular Digimon The Movies 1-3 Collection, which released last December. The first collection is currently out of stock everywhere, so if you're interested in watching the new collection at launch, it'd be wise to preorder. Digimon The Movies 4-6 Collection (Blu-ray) $20 (was $30) | Releases December 30 Digimon: The Movies 4-6 Collection includes the following movies with both English dubs and the original Japanese audio with subtitles: Revenge of the Diaboromon (2001) Battle of Adventurers (2001) Runaway Locomon (2002) Though referred to as \"movies,\" these aren't feature-length films. Revenge of the Diaboromon is 29 minutes and is set during the Digimon Adventure 02 timeline. Battle of Adventurers released the same year and has a 50-minute runtime. It was the first movie in the Digimon Tamers timeline, the third Digimon series, and revolves around a virus that causes Digimon to enter the Real World. Runaway Locomon, a 30-minute short film, released in 2002 and takes place after the Digimon Tamers season finale. The collection has a total runtime of 2 hours and 9 minutes. The runtime is 10 minutes longer than the originals because these are uncut versions that were restored with English dubs by Discotek. The runtimes listed above correspond with the original releases, not the uncut versions. Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Crunchyroll Digimon The Movies 1-3 Collection (Blu-ray) $24 (was $30) Digimon: The Movies 1-3 Collection released on Blu-ray last December and was on sale for only $18 (was $30) for Black Friday. That deal caused it to sell out at all retailers. Crunchyroll is letting customers place orders for $24, but the Blu-ray is currently on backorder with an undetermined shipping date. Digimon Adventure (1999) Our War Game (2000) Hurricane Touchdown (2000) Parts of these three movies were spliced together to create Digimon: The Movie (2000), the first feature-length theatrical release for the franchise. Discotek restored the uncut versions of all three short films with a new English dub. The runtime for the collection is 2 hours and 9 minutes, more than 40 minutes longer than the 88-minute feature film. The Blu-ray collection also comes with Digimon: The Movie's original dubbed version, so fans can watch the story as they did in theaters as kids, too.

    "description": "Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is having a remarkable second run this month after winning Game of the Year at The Game Awards. It was already one of the top hits of the year, but that added exposure has pushed Expedition 33 even higher than before. According to Alinea Analytics, sales of Expedition 33 jumped 21% on PlayStation 5 and 76% on Steam. The bump was a considerably smaller 3% on Xbox, likely because Expedition 33 is on Game Pass. Regardless, the combined sales across PC and consoles post-The Game Awards is estimated to be over 200,000 additional copies. Sandfall deftly timed new DLC for Expedition 33 to drop almost as soon as it won its final award at The Game Awards. That likely helped fuel the rush of new and returning players that pushed it to 56,993 concurrent players over the weekend, via SteamDB. That's the game's highest count since June.

Target has more exclusive Lego sets than any other major retailer, including a bunch of models designed for adults.

While all three games in the series were originally released as standalone digital editions between 2018 and 2023, they were recently collected into the physical The Turok Trilogy Bundle, which launched for PS5 and Nintendo Switch on October 31. And now, just a few weeks since launch, the collection is up to $30 off at multiple online retailers. GameStop currently has the best deal, offering the PS5 and Switch editions for just $28 (was $40). Meanwhile, Amazon, Target, and Walmart are all selling the game for $30. Just note that the deal is selling out fast--in fact, the Switch version is already sold out at Walmart, so grab the deal quickly before it's gone.

See at Amazon See at GameStop See at Target Nightdive's Turok Remaster trilogy is also available digitally, but this deal does not apply to the digital releases. The original Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, based on the Valiant Comics series, launched in 1997 for the Nintendo 64 and Windows, becoming an instant classic in the FPS genre. The game was followed by two single-player sequels, Turok 2: Seeds of Evil and Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion--both released on Nintendo 64. The trilogy follows various warriors who take up the mantle of Turok--warriors who protect Earth and a parallel dimension known as the Lost Land from prehistoric monsters, high-tech super soldiers, and inter-dimensional aliens.

    "description": "After two and a half years, eleven seasons, and one massive, game-changing expansion, Diablo 4's Age of Hatred is finally coming to a close. Announced as part of 2025's The Game Awards, Diablo 4's next expansion, Lord of Hatred, marks the end of the game's ongoing saga--one which has seen Lilith, Inarius, Mephisto, and the humans of Sanctuary engage in an epic struggle to gain control of the world and its future. But while the upcoming expansion promises a \"satisfying\" conclusion and an \"epic, final showdown\" with the game's big bad, Mephisto, it also promises a number of other exciting features, too. Prior to the expansion's announcement, GameSpot, IGN, and PC Gamer were invited to attend an exclusive interview with two key members of Lord of Hatred's narrative team: lead narrative designer Matt Burns and narrative designer Eleni Rivera. The pair were eager to answer our questions about Lord of Hatred, even those that were, admittedly, both thirsty and bizarre. We left the Q&amp;A session with a better understanding of Mephisto's plans, the lore behind the revamped Paladin class, and the Skovos Isles, as well as a great deal of anticipation--anticipation for more personality-filled dialogue options, plenty of \"Jedi mind tricks,\" and the return of Amazons, Lilith, and Ralph Ineson's velvety voice. IGN: Vessel of Hatred felt like you guys were holding your breath. Was that a Band-Aid or a part of the story that you always wanted to tell? I'm sure you guys heard a little bit of the feedback that Vessel of Hatred was good and also felt like it was teasing out of the showdown that we were all really waiting for. I'm wondering how much of that was planned versus you guys just taking longer to produce this big showdown. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
