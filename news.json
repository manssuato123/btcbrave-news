    "description": "Rockstar Games' Red Dead Redemption 2 has some moments of levity, but it's not a comedic farce. Or at least it wasn't until a modder found a way to bring the chaotic energy of Super Monkey Ball into game with Arthur as the monkey inside of the ball. YouTube host Blurbs recently fielded requests for Red Dead Redemption 2, including the aforementioned Super Monkey Ball mod. Before it could be finished, Blurbs had to work out how to put Arthur into a ball and and add gyroscopic controls and little bananas for Arthur to collect. But the crowning touch was to let the monkey ball unleash a path of destruction in its wake. I completely recreated Super Monkey Ball inside of RDR2. I asked popular streamers for mod ideas, so blame them. pic.twitter.com/WtltktmxYw — Blurbs (@Blurbstv) December 9, 2025 That was only one of the requests that Blurbs completed for the full video. Some of the others included the creation a gunicorn--a horse with a usable gun attached to their head--as well as a separate gun that can turn NPCs into horses, in addition to birds that target Arthur with their explosive poop. To cap it off, Blurbs activates all of the mods at once, which sends Arthur into Super Monkey Ball mode at very inopportune times. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Berseria follows Velvet Crowe, a young woman bent on vengeance after the murder of her brother. It's a deep, emotional tale of self-reflection and the power of letting go. Despite launching after Zestria, Berseria's prequel story is approachable even if you haven't played Zestria. In fact, like the majority of the Tales series, you can play Tales of Berseria without prior knowledge of the other games. It even seems like Bandai Namco plans for new players to start here, considering Zestria has not been remastered yet. With the cadence of remastered Tales games, it seems to only be a matter of time before Bandai Namco announces a remaster of Tales of Zestiria to give both new fans and veterans alike the complete story with modern improvements.

A few bugs are squashed for Season 1's new Astra Malorum Zombies map. The patch notes address an issue where Oscar could become stuck in the starting area, and it also fixes the map's new LGM-1 Wonder Weapon, which could sometimes fire with unintended behavior when paired with certain GobbleGums and the Frenzied Fire augment. Unfortunately, this also affects a strategy players were using to help make the Wonder Weapon more powerful during the tough boss fight for Astra Malorum.

The wonderful PS5-exclusive 3D platformer normally sells for $60 and rarely receives discounts, but you can grab a copy for only $40 through December 18. This deal kicked off last month alongside the rest of the Black Friday PlayStation hardware and game deals. Amazon sold out of copies within days, but the deal is back in stock as of December 10. The Astro Bot discount is also available at PlayStation Direct, Walmart, Target, and Best Buy. Unfortunately, the Astro Bot Joyful DualSense Controller deal remains sold out at all retailers. You can, however, save $20 on other limited-edition models, including the Walmart-exclusive Icon Blue DualSense. Astro Bot Physical Edition $40 (was $60) Astro Bot is a 3D platformer starring Team Asobi's plucky, titular robot hero as he embarks on a galaxy-spanning quest to save his comrades from an evil alien. The superb adventure builds off of the foundation of Astro's Playroom, the free pack-in game that launched with the PS5 console to showcase the DualSense Controller's unique features. Over the course of 90-plus levels, Astro Bot makes brilliant use of the DualSense's adaptive triggers, haptic feedback, touch panel, gyro controls, and built-in speaker. From a mechanical perspective, Astro Bot is arguably the most inventive and playful 3D platformer ever made. Astro Bot also doubles as a celebration of all things PlayStation. You'll meet little robots themed around other PlayStation heroes and heroines, including Ratchet, Rivet, Kratos, Atreus, Aloy, Nathan Drake, Sly Cooper, Jak, Crash Bandicoot, and many more. Some of the levels are even themed around different franchises and implement mechanics from those games. Astro Bot earned a 9/10 in GameSpot's review and won GOTY at last year's Game Awards.

Earlier this year, the small-scale studio took the world by storm with its debut title, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Despite being Sandfall's first game, the narrative-driven, turn-based RPG quickly entered the pantheon of all-time greatest RPGs, earning nearly universal critical acclaim for its artistry, story, and espousal of mechanics and themes typically associated with Japanese RPGs. Now, Sandfall Interactive stands poised to make The Game Awards history. Last month, the studio broke The Game Awards' record for most award nominations, earning a whopping 13, including Game of the Year. Earlier this year, I spoke with the studio's creative director, Guillaume Broche, who said the team was in \"disbelief\" about how the game has been received; it stands to reason that this sentiment has only grown with the game's tremendous success.
