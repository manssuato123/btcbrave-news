It's not the only Bethesda adaptation coming to Amazon's streaming service--a Wolfenstein show is coming as well--and some fans are hoping to see The Elder Scrolls game follow. Bethesda's Todd Howard--who has worked as a producer on Fallout and Elder Scrolls titles--won't rule out the possibility that it could happen. But don't expect an Elder Scrolls series anytime soon. While speaking with Eurogamer, Howard said that he \"can't rule in or rule out an Elder Scrolls thing in the future,\" before adding that he thought Fallout was more suitable as an adaptation because it had \"more to say in its genre.\" \"But you never know,\" added Howard. \"I think the impact of the show on Fallout as a franchise has been bigger than I expected, so it does make you think like, 'Hey, is there a path?' But nothing today… [and] I'm willing to say 'no' for a decade.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

As part of the new Winter Offensive, players will be able to access a new version of the Empire State map called Ice Lock Empire State. This map will only be around for a limited time, but it swaps out the standard map with frozen streets and other examples of cold and hazardous weather. The new map will also have a themed event mode, allowing you to play Domination, Conquest, and Gauntlet mission variations that utilize the new \"Freeze\" mechanic. Players will also be given access to the ice climbing axe through the Winter Offensive Bonus Path. Once they have the axe, players can unleash it as a melee weapon on unlucky foes. That bonus path also features an 11-tier, time-limited reward track featuring event cosmetics, and XP Boosters. According to Battlefield Labs, the new update has \"a broad range of fixes and refinements across Battlefield 6.\" Some of the improvements include weapon reliability, vehicle behavior, and quality-of-life bug fixes.
