It's a \"wall-to-wall\" guild built to protect employees from AI while negotiating for ample benefits, such as remote work, and Microsoft appears to have recognized the studio's union. In a press release on the CWA's website, id Software's 165-person union will join the CWA Local 6215 division in Richardson, Texas. Producer Andrew Willis noted how important it is for workers to fight back against the injustices facing the games industry at the moment. \"The wall-to-wall organizing effort at id Software was much needed; it's incredibly important that developers across the industry unite to push back on all the unilateral workplace changes that are being handed down from industry executives,\" Willis said. \"The union is a way for us, the developers, to take back control of the industry we love and to ensure that it delivers high-quality products from high-quality workers who have health benefits and longevity beyond quarterly profits.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Not only have those ports been well received, but they've also been best-sellers, and next year will see the arrival of Halo and Forza Horizon on PlayStation. In a new interview, Microsoft's president of game content and studios, Matt Booty, spoke about the success of Xbox games on PS5 and the reaction to Halo's announcement for PS5. \"We had a bit of a moment earlier in the summer from end of April to end of June, where we had six of the top 10 games on PlayStation were our Xbox games,\" Booty said to Variety. \"I look at that as validation for the teams, but most importantly, it's an opportunity for more players to engage with our content, to come into our worlds.\" Halo has long been considered the crown jewel of Xbox, and the next game in the franchise, a campaign-only remake of the original titled Halo: Campaign Evolved, will launch simultaneously on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 in 2026. Booty said the announcement was well received and that Microsoft was really pleased with its efforts to bring its content to more people. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty touched on this year's installment of the military shooter series, and although he didn't address sales numbers directly, he did acknowledge the hardships of the franchise's annual model. Speaking to Variety, Booty said that \"shipping a major franchise like clockwork every year is a really difficult task, and I’m really proud of what the team did to move the franchise forward in that way.\" A new Call of Duty game has been released every year since the franchise's beginning in 2003, and it doesn't appear that Xbox-owned publisher Activision will stop this pattern any time soon. The only change to the release model is that the series will no longer release back-to-back installments of the same subseries, as Modern Warfare and Black Ops have both done.

    "description": "A movie based on Activision's Call of Duty series is in the works now at Paramount, which is now led by billionaire and Call of Duty superfan David Ellison. Prolific writer and director Taylor Sheridan is writing the script for the film, with Lone Survivor director Peter Berg attached to direct. Activision had been trying to make Call of Duty movies for years, so why is it finally happening now? Xbox boss Matt Booty told Variety that \"a relationship came about\" between people at Paramount and senior executives working on Call of Duty. \"They felt like they found a partner who understands the game, people who play the game, and shared a vision of what it could be to bring that forward,\" Booty said. Activision originally announced it would make Call of Duty movies through its Activision Blizzard Studios label that was formed in 2015, led by Hollywood producers Stacey Sher and Nick van Dyk, and charged with adapting Activision Blizzard's franchises for film and TV. A Call of Duty movie universe was planned at one point, but, as often happens in Hollywood, nothing ever happened. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "As announced at The Game Awards, Mega Man is officially making his comeback in a new game, Mega Man: Dual Overdrive. Since the franchise began in 1987, the evil Dr. Wiley has been creating robot bosses to challenge Mega Man and keep him from foiling whatever nefarious plans he had. Now, it's your turn to design a robot boss for Mega Man to fight in Dual Overdrive. The Mega Man: Dual Overdrive Robot Design Contest has already begun, but there are some restrictions. Capcom already has a base design in mind for this boss, and it's looking for a Robot Master with a right arm that has \"immense suction powers.\" Starting from the template shared by Capcom, players aged 13 and up are encouraged to put their own spin on this villain. The full details are available on Capcom's site, and entries will be accepted from Japan, North America, South America, Europe, and Asia through January 1, 2026 at 11:59 PM PST. Contestants will have to follow the @Megaman account on X to submit their creations. Capcom's staff will narrow the designs down until they pick the six best entries, and the final winner will be chosen from that group. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

And what does Microsoft think about pricing for its games going forward? Head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty told Variety that the decision to roll back prices from $80 to $70 came about from listening to player feedback and trying to deliver \"player value.\" \"We've reacted in the last year and I think for us, the real focus is going to be ... meeting people where they are. I think there's going to be less of a focus on what's that top line price of a game, as people start to engage in different ways with games,\" he said. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
