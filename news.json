No other films look quite like del Toro's, and if you've ever wanted to take a peek inside his process, then you'll want to grab the reissue of Guillermo del Toro: Cabinet of Curiosities - My Notebooks, Collections, and Other Obsessions. This new edition of the book launched back in October, but is now discounted to $45 (was $60) for a limited time at Amazon. This could make for the perfect holiday gift for the del Toro fan in your life--just make sure you snag a copy while Amazon's discount is still available. Guillermo del Toro: Cabinet of Curiosities (Hardcover) $45 (was $60) | Limited-time deal Cabinet of Curiosities is a collection of Guillermo del Toro's illustrated diaries, production notes, and more. The offer a look into the development of his visual sensibilities, as well as closer looks at themes common to his work. The book also includes a lengthy interview with del Toro by New York Times best-selling author and filmmaker Marc Scott Zicree, discussing del Toro's personal inspirations. See at Amazon While this deal is for the new 2025 edition of Cabinet of Curiosities, the original 2013 edition is also still available at Amazon for $64. While the books are essentially identical in content, the older book might be a little worse for wear after spending 12 years in an Amazon warehouse. We'd only recommend grabbing this version if the 2025 edition sells out, but it's worth keeping in mind. Del Toro's latest project is Frankenstein, a Netflix film adaptation of the classic Mary Shelley story about Victor Frankenstein and his monstrous creation. The film features an ensemble cast that includes Oscar Isaac as the infamous doctor and Jacob Elordi as his resurrected creation. While the movie is available to stream on Netflix, you can also dive into the creation of the film with Frankenstein: Written and Directed by Guillermo del Toro, available for $75. There's also Frankenstein: The Complete Screenplay, which includes the film's script alongside concept art and set photography. It's on sale for $21 (was $30) at Amazon.

    "description": "Fallout 76's Burning Springs update is live, bringing the game's largest map expansion yet. The patch notes for Burning Springs also highlight new Bounty features, more wildlife, and the introduction of The Ghoul character from Amazon Prime Video's Fallout TV series. Although Fallout 76's main setting is the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Appalachia, players can now explore a brand-new bordering area with a setting in rural Ohio. Burning Springs is described as a region of southeastern Ohio affected by nuclear destruction and environmental poisoning from a chemical plant. This map expansion offers players a new questline that features a Super Mutant known as the Rust King. Highway Town is a main point-of-interest for the new region, and it serves as a social hub for some of the game's new characters. A notable location to visit is the town's Last Resort saloon, which is where players can meet Walton Goggins' character, The Ghoul, from the TV series. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The PC version of the highly anticipated Zelda-inspired roguelike is already seeing a nice discount over on Fanatical. You can pick it up for $20.09, saving you nearly $10 off the $30 launch price. This is the lowest price for the game so far, as Steam is offering the game for $24.89. Note that buying the game at Fanatical gets you an official Steam key. Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault $20 (was $30) Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault is the follow-up to the original Moonlighter, which launched in 2018, and offers the same mix of cozy shop sim and action-Roguelike gameplay its predecessor is known for. This time, however, you traverse its regions in a 3D isometric perspective, instead of the top-down 2D view of the first game. The new visual style and new gameplay mechanics also come with expanded accessibility options compared to the original. See at Fanatical Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault may be on sale on Steam through Fanatical, but it launched on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S as well, where it's available day one if you're an Xbox GamePass subscriber. The original Moonlighter came out in May 2018 to critical acclaim, and if you're a fan of 16-bit retro art styles, then this is the game for you. Fanatical also has the original on sale if you're curious about checking out the series' roots. It's currently down to $14.69 (was $20) for the PC version. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Ken Levine's Judas has been in development for a very long time, and it will be his first major project since BioShock Infinite's Burial At Sea DLC in 2014. A few of the gameplay elements we've seen from Judas greatly resemble BioShock's interface. But according to Levine, his team doesn't think of it as a first-person shooter. Instead, he called it a \"Judas simulator,\" since the main character's name is Judas. \"Judas ... understands machines in a way she can never understand people,\" wrote Levin in a developer's blog shared on PlayStation's official site. \"That became her greatest strength… and greatest weakness. We put her in a science fiction world, a colony ship filled with robots--a futuristic setting that makes someone like her extremely powerful. But it's also a world where personal success hinges on how well you can conform to the rules, because dissent would lead to the failure of the mission. That makes her an outlaw, a pariah--a Judas. That tension at the heart of the character came to inform everything about the game, which we stopped thinking of as an FPS and started calling a 'Judas Simulator.' Everything comes back to that core idea of you interacting with the world as Judas.\" Levine noted that Judas isn't overly fond of other people, but the game's narrative forces her to pick between three different leaders on the colony space ship called The Mayflower. Players' choices as Judas will determine which of the three will call her an ally, while the others condemn her as an enemy. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
