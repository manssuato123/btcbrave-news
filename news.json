    "description": "Lego DC Batman: The Animated Series Batmobile (435 Pieces) $38.49 (was $60) | Retiring Soon See at Amazon Batman: The Complete Animated Series on Blu-ray $28.49 (was $80) See at Amazon Batman fans who grew up watching the awesome early '90s animated series will want to check out Amazon's Black Friday deal on the Lego Batmobile from the show. The 435-piece Batman: The Animated Series Batmobile is on sale for only $38.49 (was $60). This deal is especially notable because Lego is retiring this Batman building set soon. And if you'd like the perfect background noise while piecing together the Batmobile, the Blu-ray box set collecting all 85 episodes is on sale for only $28.49 for Black Friday. Lego DC Batman: The Animated Series Batmobile (435 Pieces) $38.49 (was $60) | Retiring Soon Lego released this particular Batmobile last June alongside a few other sets, including the Batman Mech Armor that's also featured in Amazon's Black Friday Lego sale. The set is technically called Batman with the Batmobile vs. Harley Quinn and Mr. Freeze, so it won't surprise you that it comes with those three characters as minifigures. Harley Quinn wields a comically large hammer, while Mr. Freeze has a functional stud launcher. The Batman minifigure is based on his look in the show and has a molded cape. The Batmobile is over 11 inches long and has removable stud launchers, a seat for one minifigure that is accessed by lifting the cockpit hatch. A detachable exhaust flame element twirls when the wheels spin. It has everything that makes a Batmobile Lego model a playset for young Caped Crusader fans--it's recommended for builders ages 8 and up--but it doubles as a nice display piece thanks to the included 360-degree rotatable stand and information placard that's more commonly seen with Lego models designed for adults. See at Amazon Batman: The Complete Animated Series on Blu-ray $28.49 (was $80) Batman: The Complete Animated Series actually includes even more than just the 85-episode series that ran from 1992-1995. It also comes with all 24 episodes of The New Adventures of Batman, Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, and Batman and Mr. Freeze. Fans should also check out the Blu-ray box set deals for three other animated series: Batman Beyond (1999), The Batman (2004), and the classic Adventures of Batman (1968).

    "description": "At the beginning of 2025, Hypergryph shared the first closed beta test for Arknights: Endfield, the free-to-play action-RPG spin-off from the Arknights franchise. Now, the second beta test has begun, and it appears to be a considerable upgrade over the game's previous state. This work-in-progress build has \"50-60 hours worth of polished content,\"a rebuilt storyline, fresh cutscenes and more according to Hypergryph. The combat has also been refined and there's a new region, Wuling, that's now ripe for exploration. The game casts players as the Endministrator, the leader of Endfield Industries who has no memory of the past. As the Endmin reclaims their life, they fight alongside companions and attempt to explore and exploit the wild planet Talos-II. Much like Satisfactory, players can extract resources from the planet and build factories to fully utilize the materials they have at hand. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

See at Amazon If you've been waiting for a discount on Lego's Pac-Man Arcade, you're in luck: The 2,651-piece retro arcade cabinet model is featured in Amazon's Black Friday 2025 Lego sale. The nostalgic officially licensed Pac-Man Arcade is available for $189 (was $270). The $81 discount is the best deal yet for the Pac-Man Arcade, which launched in June 2023. This extremely cool Lego building set for adults almost always sells for full price, and the few deals we've seen over the past two-plus years have sold out fast. Lego Icons: Pac-Man Arcade (2,651 Pieces) $189 (was $270) Part of the Lego Icons series, Pac-Man Arcade is a brick-built countertop machine model measuring 10 x 7 x 13 inches. Out of all of Lego's gaming system sets, Pac-Man Arcade is probably the most impressive from a design perspective. And it's definitely the coolest when it comes to interactive features. It has a movable four-way joystick, and you can press the two dome buttons. The crank on the side of the cabinet moves Pac-Man through the mechanical maze while Blinky and Clyde chase him. The coin slot uses a light brick that makes it look like the real thing. In addition to the cabinet itself, it comes with buildable Pac-Man, Blinky, and Clyde figures that attach to a stand that connects to the top of the cabinet. Rounding out the set is a minifigure-scale '80s arcade scene, complete with a tiny brick-built Pac-Man cabinet and a gamer minifigure wearing vintage clothes. You can store the scene inside the cabinet by removing the back panel. This also allows you to watch the mechanical components in motion while turning the crank.

It comes with a buildable display stand, a cool information placard, and nine Lego minifigures based on the crew. Shop Lego Store Black Friday Deals The Starship Enterprise (10356) comes with a free 261-piece Star Trek: Type-15 Shuttlepod (40768) if you purchase it before the Black Friday sale ends December 1.

    "title": "4K Blu-Ray Editions Of Superman, F1, And Jurassic World Rebirth Are $13 For Black Friday",
    "description": "Superman (4K Blu-ray) $12.49 (was $35) See at Amazon F1: The Movie (4K Blu-ray) $12.49 (was $30) See at Amazon Jurassic World Rebirth: Collector's Edition (4K Blu-ray) $13.49 (was $30) See at Amazon A whole bunch of recently released 4K Blu-ray films are discounted for Black Friday, including three popular movies that are now available for their lowest price ever--Superman, F1: The Movie, and Jurassic World Rebirth. These Black Friday deals won't stick around much longer, so if you're interested in adding them to your collection for cheap, swing by Amazon and check them out soon. Superman (4K Blu-ray) $12.49 (was $35) Superman hit theaters in July, and now you can bring it home for $12.49 (was $35). You'll get a 4K Blu-ray and digital copy of the film, plus over 90 minutes of bonus features. This includes behind-the-scenes featurettes like \"Adventures in the Making of Superman\" and an animated short. Both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos are supported, making this the most premium way to enjoy the superhero flick in your home theater. See at Amazon F1: The Movie (4K Blu-ray) $12.49 (was $30) Starring Brad Pitt and directed by Joseph Kosinski, director of Top Gun: Maverick, F1: The Movie earned high praise for its impressive visuals and special effects--if you're a racing fan, it's certainly worth checking out. Beyond 4K Blu-ray and digital copies of the movie, you'll get special features such as the \"Inside the F1: The Movie Table Read\" and a look at sets and locations from around the world. Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos are once again supported. See at Amazon Jurassic World Rebirth: Collector's Edition (4K Blu-ray) $13.49 (was $30) This Collector's Edition comes with 4K Blu-ray, standard Blu-ray, and digital copies of Jurassic World Rebirth. Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos are supported, and you'll find over an hour of bonus features packed into the bundle. This includes deleted scenes, an alternate opening, and a making-of documentary, among plenty of other featurettes. Starring Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali, it earned mixed reviews (but no doubt it's a fun summer blockbuster). See at Amazon While the 4K Blu-ray deals are arguably the most enticing, two of the above films are also available for cheap on standard Blu-ray. The Superman Blu-ray is $9.49 (was $30), and it gets you all the same bonus features as its fancier 4K sibling. It also supports Dolby Atmos. F1: The Movie on Blu-ray is also $9.49 (was $25), once again getting you the same bonus features as the 4K edition, plus support for Dolby Atmos. But since the 4K version of both these films is just a few bucks more expensive, most shoppers will probably find them to be the better option than standard Blu-ray. And if you want to add even more movies to your home theater, check out the Criterion Collection Black Friday Sale at Amazon, which is offering 50% discounts on hundreds of iconic films.

    "title": "The Avengers Helicarrier Lego Model Is 50% Off At Walmart",
    "description": "Lego Marvel: The Avengers Helicarrier (509 Pieces) $40 (was $80) | Black Friday Deal See at Walmart Walmart is holding a big Black Friday sale on Lego, and for Marvel fans, now is a great time to pick up the Lego Marvel Avengers Helicarrier at 50% off. On sale for $40 (was $80), this 509-piece model is a compact and detailed replica of the aerial base of operations used by Nick Fury and the Avengers in the Marvel movies. Lego Marvel: The Avengers Helicarrier (509 Pieces) $40 (was $80) | Black Friday Deal Measuring over 13 inches long and 8.5 inches wide, the helicarrier is designed as a display piece. It can be mounted on a sturdy base after assembly, and it features numerous screen-accurate details in Lego form. The runway features pieces resembling Quinjets, engines powered by Tony Stark's Arc Reactor technology, a series of propellers to keep the vessel airborne, and a command deck overseeing all operations. This makes for a quick lunchtime build, and like other Lego sets, you'll find the instruction booklet included. You can also use the Lego Builder app for an interactive walkthrough of each step. See at Walmart Another notable Lego Marvel deal at Walmart is the Marvel Logo and Minifigures set. This 931-piece set is priced at $80 (was $100) for Black Friday, and it's a tribute to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Not only can you build the iconic Marvel logo, but you can also make several minifigures spring out from secret compartments. Amazon is also price-matching this set, in case it sells out at Walmart. Walmart has also discounted several other popular Star Wars Lego vehicles. The 630-piece Executor Super Star Destroyer is on sale for $40 (was $70), Princess Leia's transport vessel Tantive IV has been discounted by 50% to $40, and you can pair that with the diorama piece Boarding the Tantive IV for $38.49 (was $55). The 502-piece set is being retired soon, so this is a nice deal on a set that accurately recreates the opening scene from A New Hope. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
