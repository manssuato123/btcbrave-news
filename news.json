Starting today, No Gravity Games is giving away one Switch title per day through December 19, on which day there will be three free games. However, there is a catch that works out in your favor. To claim a free game on Switch, players need to have claimed the previous day's title and maintained it in their library. You must also have at least one No Gravity title prior to claiming the first freebie, but there's a trick you can use to get that for free, too. Just visit No Gravity Games' official site and sign up for the newsletter, and you'll receive a free game. If you do this first, it will count as a \"purchased\" game from No Gravity and you're able to then claim the other games for free. If players do miss a day, they can rejoin the giveaway chain by purchasing the previous day's game, which will be available at a greatly reduced price. Each title becomes available for free at midnight PT and they will be available to claim on Nintendo's eShop until 11:59pm PT on the same day. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
