    "description": "It's been a busy week for industry speculation after Geoff Keighley started posting about a mysterious, glowing monolith in the middle of the California desert, which was later moved into Los Angeles. Now, it appears the monolith's mystery might have just been solved through a trademark filing. Rumors that the monolith was erected to tease new Diablo 4 content, Elder Scrolls 6, God of War, or Lords of the Fallen 2 were all shot down by people in the know. While others speculated that it still could be related to The Elder Scrolls Online, or a new FromSoft game, it appears most likely that the statue is promoting a new Divinity title from Larian. A trio of trademark filings were spotted up by MP1st, including a new Divinity logo and a symbol that looks suspiciously like the glowing one on Geoff Keighley's monolith. The familiar-looking trademarks come after Larian's publishing director said there aren't currently any plans for a Divinity: Original Sin 3, meaning the upcoming title may be a new Divinity game outside of the Original Sin prequel series.

IGN reported revealed the upcoming project in an interview with key players from both CD Projekt Red and WeirdCo, who share a mutual passion for bringing Cyberpunk to the TCG space--which will also mark CD Projekt Red's first physical TCG. \"Every one of us at WeirdCo loves the Cyberpunk universe, and we built the TCG bit by bit on this foundation,\" WeirdCo co-founder Elliot Cook said, revealing that the team looked not only to 2077 and Edgerunners for inspiration, but also the Dark Horse comic series. \"At each step we analyzed every little detail, constantly asking ourselves: 'How do we make this more authentic to Cyberpunk?'\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

We expected the 40% discount on this Lego Super Mario display model to disappear on Monday, but it's actually available at more retailers than before. Best Buy featured the Piranha Plant in its weekend doorbuster sale, and Amazon quickly matched the deal. But while Best Buy indeed raised the price back to $60 when the sale ended, Amazon's deal remained available and has since been joined by matching deals at Walmart and Target. It's unclear when the discount will expire at these retailers; Target mentions December 10 on its store page, but end dates at Target aren't always reliable. You can get free shipping at all three retailers, and the Piranha Plant will arrive with plenty of time to spare before Christmas. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Released last year with a $90 retail price, the three-film 4K Blu-ray box set is on sale for only $39 at Amazon.

The Gibson SG 20th Anniversary Edition retails for $135 and is slated to launch December 19. Notably, this is the first wireless guitar controller in CRKD's catalog licensed by PlayStation. The Gibson SG syncs wirelessly to PS5, PS4, PS3, and PC via a 2.4GHz dongle. The multiplatform version of CRKD's Gibson Les Paul Guitar Controller is limited to a wired connection on PS5 and PS4, so the Gibson SG is likely the better option for Fortnite Festival and Rock Band 4 players on PlayStation. PS5 players now have two officially licensed wireless guitar controllers to choose from. The other is the PDP Riffmaster, which is still on sale for its $110 (was $150) Black Friday price.

The new thriller from director Yorgos Lanthimos and producer Emma Stone--who also stars in the film alongside Jesse Plemons--wasn't a box office hit, but it's certainly an unforgettable movie. If you missed it when it came out, you can preorder it now ahead of its December 23 release, with options for a limited-edition 4K Blu-ray, standard 4K Blu-ray, standard Blu-ray, and DVD. Bugonia Collector's Edition Steelbook (4K) $38 | Releases December 23 The Collector's Edition steelbook cover uses Bugonia's theatrical posters for its exterior and interior artwork, which hint at the film's weird, conspiratorial tone. Like other Blu-ray releases, you'll get the film on a 4K Blu-ray disc, a standard Blu-ray disc, and a digital streaming code to watch it online. For bonus features, the Blu-ray includes a documentary on the making of Bugonia, interviews with the cast and crew, behind-the-scenes footage, and more.

The film follows two conspiracy-obsessed cousins (Plemons and Aidan Dobis) who are convinced that the CEO of a powerful company (Stone) is actually an alien in disguise, hellbent on wiping out humanity. After kidnapping and trapping her in their basement, the trio engages in a battle of wits, interrogation, and torture, with the film becoming increasingly unpredictable as it races towards its conclusion. While it wasn't a box-office hit, Bugonia did earn relatively high praise from critics and audiences alike thanks to the standout performances of the cast and its wild plot twists. For more Blu-ray deals, you can check out various specials right now. The Hobbit Trilogy on 4K Blu-ray has gotten a big discount, and the box set for the A Better Tomorrow Trilogy has also gotten a substantial price cut. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
