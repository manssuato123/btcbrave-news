Yasuke and Noae weren't the first dual protagonists in an Assassin's Creed game. Twins Jacob and Evie were featured in Assassin's Creed Syndicate. Shadows had more pronounced differences between its two heroes than Syndicate did. Yasuke was built for physical confrontations while Naoe was refined for stealth. Lemay-Comtois acknowledged those differences and some of the backlash the team faced because of Yasuke's inclusion. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Microsoft originally rejected a pitch to bring Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 to PlayStation consoles, but the company eventually agreed, and this led to a \"whole avalanche\" of Xbox games on PlayStation. That's according to Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator Jorg Neumann. He told XDA-Developers that it was his own idea to bring Flight Simulator to PlayStation consoles, culminating with the launch of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 today, December 8, on PS4 and PS5. The 2020 Flight Simulator game eventually grew to become 300 GB in size, and there was so much content planned that Neumann said the game could grow to become 1 TB. So instead of doing that, the team made a new game, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and the game now only has 8 GB of space for a requirement, with everything else sent to the cloud. This way of packaging the game allowed the game to come to other platforms, Neumann said. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Elden Ring Nightreign launched with eight powerful nightfarers for you to use on your expeditions, each offering unique gameplay styles and abilities. However, the game's first (and potentially only) DLC, The Forsaken Hollows, introduces two new nightfarers that will mix things up even further: Scholar and Undertaker. The Scholar is a support character with high Arcane scaling (perfect for bleed builds) who can buff party members, debuff enemies, and make use of a powerful passive that levels items by simply using them. Meanwhile, the Undertaker has incredible scaling in Strength and Faith, as well as a high-damage ultimate ability that can be triggered multiple times while using her character skill, making her a perfect choice for aggressive players who love to dish out the pain while also having some extra healing options. If you're curious about these new characters and want to try them out for yourself, we've got you covered. Here's how to unlock the Scholar and Undertaker. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

But then Nightdive wondered about bringing the classic immersive to both Nintendo hybrid consoles and found out Unreal Engine 4 was a possibility. \"Once we made that discovery, we did that big pivot for a few reasons--the biggest was stability,\" said developer Thomas Curnow.

Within this year, it will be set,\" Hamaguchi said in an interview with Julien Chièze (via a translation by Genki_JPN). So far, the first two games in the Final Fantasy Remake trilogy have followed a similar naming convention. Remake got the ball rolling with its title, while Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth's title emphasized a new beginning for the franchise. So what could Part 3's name be if it follows this trend?
