    "description": "This week, From Software's Elden Ring Nightreign is expanding with The Forsaken Hollows DLC, which adds two new playable characters, two extra bosses, and a fresh Shifting Earth event. But if you want to play that DLC, then you'll need to add the new Nightreign Version 1.03 patch across PC and consoles. One of the primary changes in this patch is that the trigger conditions for Relic effects have been broadened. The game's passive effects have been increased, which include greater attacking power when using two-handed weapons or armaments, as well as chain attacks, charge attacks, and jump attacks. The Wrath of Gold incantation has been given a power boost, while decreasing the cost to players' FP consumption. There are a number of bug fixes in this patch as well, including one that was teleporting players to the wrong area during the Augur invasion if they were performing a critical hit at the time. Under certain conditions, players weren't able to activate Sites of Grace or Churches, but the notes say the issue has been \"mitigated.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack $25.31 (was $30) See at Amazon See at Walmart Another Metroid Amiibo launches this week with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. The third and final Metroid Prime 4 Amiibo, Sylux, is available to order for $30 at Amazon and other major retailers. Like other Amiibo released during the Switch 2 era, all three Metroid Prime 4 Amiibo are more expensive than collectors were used to before 2025. That's why it's refreshing to see Amazon restock the Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack for $25.31 (was $30). The Dread Amiibo set isn't difficult to find for around MSRP, but it's rare to see it sold by a major retailer. Usually you need to buy it from a third-party seller, but this restock is sold and shipped by Amazon. Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack $25.31 (was $30) The Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack is cool for multiple reasons. For Samus fans, it's one of the few collectibles featuring the bounty hunter's regenerating Varia Suit. The blue-tinged sections on the suit are organic matter from the Fusion Suit. This directly ties back to the events of Metroid Fusion. In the 2002 Game Boy Advance game, Samus was infected by the X parasite. She received the Metroid vaccine, but when Dread starts, her Varia Suit is still in the process of regenerating to its normal form. This Samus Amiibo is cool, but the E.M.M.I. Amiibo might be cooler. One of the most unsettling enemies in franchise history, the Extraplanetary Multiform Mobile Identifier--better known as EMMI--is robot nightmare fuel. Like Samus, the EMMI Amiibo's pose matches official key art. If Amazon sells out, you can buy the Metroid Dread 2-Pack from a third-party seller on Walmart Marketplace for roughly the same price. See at Amazon See at Walmart Where to Buy Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Amiibo Metroid Prime 4: Beyond for Nintendo Switch 2 $70 | Releases December 4 Preorder at Best Buy Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Walmart Preorder at GameStop Preorder at Target Metroid Prime 4: Beyond for Nintendo Switch $60 | Releases December 4 Preorder at Best Buy Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Walmart Preorder at Target Preorder at GameStop If you haven't picked up the Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Amiibo, all three are in stock at Amazon.

Sylux -- $30 | Dec. 4 Amazon Walmart Target Best Buy Samus &amp; Vi-O-La -- $40 Amazon Walmart Target Best Buy Samus -- $30 Amazon Walmart Target Best Buy For more Metroid collectibles and gear: Walmart has budget-friendly action figures by Jakks Pacific; Amazon has two large Club Mocchi-Mocchi plushies inspired by Metroid Prime 4; and PowerA has Switch 2 and Switch accessories. The official Metroid Prime 4 edition of the PowerA Slim Case for Switch 2 is up for grabs for only $15 (was $20), and a Metroid Prime Trilogy Crossbody Bag is down to $20 (was $25).

    "description": "The dream of Skyblivion goes back over a decade as a team of fans came together to use The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's engine to fully recreate and re-imagine Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion as a modern RPG. At the beginning of 2023, the team set a 2025 premiere for Skyblivion. However, that's no longer the plan and Skyblivion has been pushed to next year. The good news is that the latest dev video shows off how much has been finished and what remains to be done. Skyblivion lead Rebelzize narrates the video as he offers a guide to where things stand. According to Rebelzize, most of the work has already been done and over 70 volunteer contributors are still hard at work trying to get the ambitious mod across the finish line. When this project was started, The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion was far out of date. Earlier this year, Bethesda released Oblivion Remastered, which could have taken the wind out of this team's project. Instead, Rebelzize and others praised the remaster as a \"win-win\" for the community. In recognition for their work, Bethesda gave copies of Oblivion Remastered to the entire Skyblivion mod team.

    "description": "Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle $449 (was $500) See at Amazon See at Walmart Amazon has restocked the Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle and is once again matching Walmart's deal. This promotion could end at any time, but as of December 3 at 12 PM PT, the Switch 2 with Mario Kart World is available for $449 (was $500) at Amazon and Walmart. Best Buy has increased the price back to $500, and Target sold out on Cyber Monday. Discounts on Nintendo consoles are rare in general, but it's genuinely shocking to see a deal on the Switch 2 less than six months after launch. The $51 discount will show up after you add the bundle to your cart at Walmart. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle $449 (was $500) The Mario Kart World console bundle is valued at $530, so you're essentially getting a copy of the Switch 2 exclusive for free. The bundle includes a voucher that can be redeemed on the Switch 2 eShop for the digital edition of Mario Kart World. Here's what's included inside the box: Switch 2 with 7.9-inch LCD display Joy-Con 2: Left and Right Joy-Con 2 Straps Joy-Con 2 Grip Dock for TV Mode Ultra High-Speed HDMI Cable USB-C Cable 60W AC adapter Voucher for Mario Kart World The Mario Kart bundle is selling for the same price as the Switch 2 console on its own. Nintendo previously stated the Mario Kart bundle would only be available until Fall 2025, so Amazon and Walmart might be clearing out their remaining units before the bundle disappears for good. See at Amazon See at Walmart The Switch 2 has 256GB of onboard storage, but you can expand it with a microSD Express Card. Amazon has limited time deals on Samsung's P9 512GB microSD Express and Silicon Power's 1TB microSD Express. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Speaking to Ars Technica, Gilbert said this game had a vision of being a \"large, open-world-type RPG\" in the vein of The Legend of Zelda. Gilbert worked alongside two other people--an artist and a designer--for about a year on the project before Gilbert realized it was not going to happen. \"I just [didn't] have the money or the time to build a big open-world game like that,\" he said. \"You know, it's either a passion project you spent 10 years on, or you just need a bunch of money to be able to hire people and resources.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",
