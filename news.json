We'd only recommend grabbing this version if the 2025 edition sells out, but it's worth keeping in mind. Del Toro's latest project is Frankenstein, a Netflix film adaptation of the classic Mary Shelley story about Victor Frankenstein and his monstrous creation. The film features an ensemble cast that includes Oscar Isaac as the infamous doctor and Jacob Elordi as his resurrected creation. While the movie is available to stream on Netflix, you can also dive into the creation of the film with Frankenstein: Written and Directed by Guillermo del Toro, available for $75.

Burning Springs is described as a region of southeastern Ohio affected by nuclear destruction and environmental poisoning from a chemical plant. This map expansion offers players a new questline that features a Super Mutant known as the Rust King.

    "description": "Ken Levine's Judas has been in development for a very long time, and it will be his first major project since BioShock Infinite's Burial At Sea DLC in 2014. A few of the gameplay elements we've seen from Judas greatly resemble BioShock's interface. But according to Levine, his team doesn't think of it as a first-person shooter. Instead, he called it a \"Judas simulator,\" since the main character's name is Judas. \"Judas ... understands machines in a way she can never understand people,\" wrote Levin in a developer's blog shared on PlayStation's official site. \"That became her greatest strength… and greatest weakness. We put her in a science fiction world, a colony ship filled with robots--a futuristic setting that makes someone like her extremely powerful. But it's also a world where personal success hinges on how well you can conform to the rules, because dissent would lead to the failure of the mission. That makes her an outlaw, a pariah--a Judas. That tension at the heart of the character came to inform everything about the game, which we stopped thinking of as an FPS and started calling a 'Judas Simulator.' Everything comes back to that core idea of you interacting with the world as Judas.\" Levine noted that Judas isn't overly fond of other people, but the game's narrative forces her to pick between three different leaders on the colony space ship called The Mayflower. Players' choices as Judas will determine which of the three will call her an ally, while the others condemn her as an enemy. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Marvel Cosmic Invasion Deluxe Edition $60 | Releases March 13, 2026 Preorder at Best Buy Preorder at GameStop Marvel Cosmic Invasion Standard Edition $40 | Releases March 13, 2026 Preorder at Best Buy Preorder at GameStop Marvel Cosmic Invasion launches digitally on PC and console next month, but those holding out for a physical release will need to hold out a bit longer. The PS5, Xbox Series X, Switch 2, and Switch physical editions of the game launch on March 13, 2026, but the upshot is that fans can preorder the game now at Best Buy and GameStop. While there are no preorder bonuses announced, you can secure copies of the $40 Standard Edition (or $50 on Switch 2) and $60 Deluxe Edition (or $70 on Switch 2), with the latter including extra content like a steelbook case, a poster, art cards, and a sticker sheet. Walmart is also listing preorders, but all versions are currently sold out, so we recommend preordering at one of the other retailers soon in case it sells out there as well. Marvel Cosmic Invasion Deluxe Edition $60 | Releases March 13, 2026 The Deluxe Edition of Marvel Cosmic Invasion includes the full game and a selection of physical collectibles. Here's a rundown of everything included: Marvel Cosmic Invasion base game Steelbook case 15 premium art cards Poster Two sticker sheets Deluxe Edition Box Marvel Cosmic Invasion Deluxe Edition is available on PS5, Xbox Series X, Switch 2, and Switch. Note that the Switch 2 version costs $70, which is $10 more than on the other platforms, but it includes the full game on the cartridge, which is rare among third-party Switch 2 releases that opt for a Game Key-Card format instead.

Designed to look like an old-school SNES action game with its pixel-art graphics, the game features a roster of 15 heroes. The lineup includes popular characters like Captain America, Storm, and Spider-Man, alongside more obscure heroes like Beta Ray Bill and Quasar, all rendered in a style that evokes classic ’90s video games.
