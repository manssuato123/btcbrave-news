Friday the 13th Collection Deluxe Edition is on sale for a massive 34% discount that drops the price to only $106 (was $160). Released in 2020 to rave reviews from fans and critics, this 16-disc Blu-ray box set is the only Friday the 13th collection with all 12 movies. With Amazon's deal, you're paying $8.83 per movie, and that's without factoring in the mountain of special features, premium display case, and collector's booklet. The Friday the 13th Collection Deluxe Edition was discontinued by Shout Factory over the holidays. It's been sold out for months at multiple retailers, but Amazon has restocked it a few times. Just keep in mind that Amazon often sells the set for the full $160 price, so this deal is unlikely to be available for long. Amazon is also offering steep discounts on the 4K Blu-ray editions of Friday the 13th (1980), Jason Goes to Hell, and Jason X. Fans can also preorder Friday the 13th: Part 2 and Friday the 13th (2009) on 4K Blu-ray ahead of their shared February 3 launch date.

See at Amazon See at Lego Store Lego's latest batch of 3-in-1 Creator sets includes a pretty cool gaming-themed kit. The 268-piece Lego Retro Gaming Console retails for $20 and can be built as a handheld game system, miniature arcade machine, or desktop computer. Recommended for builders ages eight and up, the Lego Creator 3-in-1 Retro Gaming Console launched January 1 and is in stock at Amazon, Best Buy, and the Lego Store. New Lego Creator 3-in-1 Building Sets (January 2026) The Retro Gaming Console is one of nine new Lego Creator sets. The January 2026 lineup also features the $20 Fierce Dinosaur, $30 Playful Puppy, $10 Cute Hamster, and more 3-in-1 builds. Eight of the sets are available at Amazon, but the new Space Exploration Telescope is exclusive to the Lego Store and Target.

The handheld system would look cool next to the recently released Lego Game Boy. It also happens to have similar features. There are three buildable cartridges with different patterns. The \"games\" can be placed in the cartridge slot to change the picture behind the clear display panel. The joysticks and triggers are movable, too. The arcade machine model also looks cool--though it's understandably not as detailed or as realistic as the Lego Arcade Machine. The Lego Creator Arcade Machine has two arcade sticks, colorful buttons, coin doors, and decorative flourishes on the side panels and marquee. The miniature computer is a three-piece model with a monitor resting atop the PC, a keyboard with distinct arrow keys, and a tiny mouse. See at Amazon See at Lego Store See at Best Buy Lego Gaming Hardware Sets Lego Game Boy | Lego Arcade MachineLego launched the aforementioned 468-piece Arcade Machine and the 421-piece Game Boy last year for $40 and $60, respectively. The Lego Arcade Machine, which remains exclusive to the Lego Store, has a hidden '80s gaming room inside the cabinet. The largest Lego gaming hardware build is the 2,651-piece Pac-Man Arcade for $270. Unfortunately, the awesome Lego Nintendo Entertainment System and Lego Atari 2600 were discontinued at the end of 2024. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The squad crash-lands somewhere in the Pacific. They’re the only survivors on a mysterious island that only grows stranger the deeper they venture and the longer they stay. This is Peak. Sound familiar? The stories of Lost, the Emmy-winning 2004 mystery-laden drama series, and Peak feel like two parallel tracks that move in an eerily similar and magnificent way. The mystery only grows--in both depth and complexity--the further you get, whether you’re marathoning episodes or climbing up a volcano in search of rescue. Lost worked because of that mystery. A group that crash-landed on an isolated island runs into underground bunkers, hidden groups of strangers, and a smoke monster as they try to survive and find their way home. Every new discovery widens the gap between what you think you understand and what’s actually happening. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

This week’s Fallout episode gave audiences a look into the status quo of the factions fighting for control of the Mojave Wasteland. While gamers might have an idea of where they ended up after finishing Fallout: New Vegas, it seems that a lot has changed in the wasteland in the 15 years since. While the meter didn’t move too much on individual stories, it was great to see what some of these fan favorite factions are currently up to. The episode opens up in a bottling plant for the infamous Sunset Sarsaparilla, the Mojave’s favorite drink. The plant is being operated under the watchful eye of none other than former Brotherhood of Steel Squire Thaddeus (Johnny Pemberton), who’s taking on a far more ghoulish look than when we last saw him. After consoling a young girl who was bullied, he reminds the children to get back to work and that normally they’d “be dead by now.” Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The Mojave’s Favorite Soda This week’s episode revealed the fate of Squire Thaddeus (Johnny Pemberton) and his new life as a ghoul. Instead of exploring the wasteland as part of the Brotherhood of Steel, he’s running a bottling plant that employs an army of abandoned children. The drink they’re bottling?

Resellers have been selling Spider-Verse mystery boxes for around $50, so Amazon will probably sell out again soon. While you're on Amazon, you should also check out the newly released Miles Morales Mech vs. Spider-Man 2099 Lego set, which is only $15 and is also based on Across the Spider-Verse; it's one of 12 new Lego Marvel models and playsets available at Amazon. If you're interested in collecting this Lego minifigure series, now's the time to grab a box or two. Spider-Verse minifigures are sold out at all other major retailers and the Lego Store. Most retailers sold out shortly after the collection launched in September and never restocked the mystery boxes or singles. And with the new Lego Minifigure Animal Series 28 Collection now available, it's unlikely the Spider-Verse minifigures stick around for much longer.

See at Amazon See at Best Buy See at Lego Store Eight new Harry Potter Lego sets launched this week at Amazon, the Lego Store, Best Buy, and other major retailers. Longtime fans of the franchise will want to pay special attention to the 25th Anniversary sets. To mark the anniversary of the Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone film adaptation, Lego designed five models and playsets that call back to the 2001 movie. The star of the lineup is the Lego Harry Potter 25th Anniversary Sorcerer's Stone Collector's Edition, a 1,571-piece display model featuring iconic characters, objects, and scenes from the movie. The new $170 Collector's Edition set is already on backorder at the Lego Store, but it's in stock at Amazon and Best Buy. If you have a My Best Buy Plus/Total membership, you'll save 10%, which drops the price to $153. The Sorcerer's Stone Collector's Edition will remind fans of the Hogwarts Icons Collector's Edition from Lego's 20th Anniversary celebration in 2021. Both models feature Hedwig and numerous objects fro the first movie. The 3,010-piece Hogwarts Icons set is officially retired and regularly sells for well above its original $300 price, so it's worth keeping that in mind if you're interested in the new model.

    "title": "The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy Is The Ultimate \"What If\" Game",
    "description": "At the beginning of 2025, I fully believed I had grown tired of stories about multiple timelines. During the past decade, the Marvel Cinematic Universe pushed the classic comic book narrative device into the mainstream, fueling a film conglomerate with legally approved cameos, flashy visuals on the silver screen, and loose plots that, eventually, came together for one final pay-off. While the concept of the multiverse has been explored in film and TV even before Marvel's takeover, it quickly became the narrative foundation of choice. When done right, the potential is undeniable--works like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and Everything, Everywhere, All at Once are heartwrenching displays of interpersonal relationships, making characters face the reality of what-if scenarios, reconciling with their choices and what could have been if they had turned the other way instead. But you can only hear the same tune so many times before it starts to lose its original impact. It wasn't until The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy that my interest was reanimated. The visual novel and strategy-RPG hybrid presents itself as deceivingly linear, only to push you into a completely different story structure at the very end. It makes for a sprawling web of outcomes based on your choices, all while showcasing different perspectives on events and characters that weave absurdity and sentimentality in equal measure in a showcase of creative prowess from the development team.
