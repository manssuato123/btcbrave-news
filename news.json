    "title": "Battlefield 6 For PS5 And Xbox Gets 50% Discount For Black Friday",
    "description": "Battlefield 6 $35 (was $70) See at Amazon Battlefield 6 is on sale for a massive discount for PS5 and Xbox Series X for Black Friday. Amazon is offering a 50% discount on the physical edition, dropping the price from $70 to $35 on both platforms. Battlefield 6 launched October 10, so a 50% discount this soon, especially for a game that was already selling well, is surprising. Amazon has already sold out of this deal at least once, so snag a copy of the new multiplayer FPS while you can. Battlefield 6 $35 (was $70) The Battlefield 6 standard edition includes the base game on your platform of choice. While the game is packed with tons of single-player and multiplayer content, there's also the Battlefield 6 Season Pass available as a separate in-game purchase for those who want to add a bit more personality to their online persona. See at Amazon After a misstep with Battlefield 2042, DICE seems to be back on track with Battlefield 6. Our Battlefield 6 review gave it a 7/10, shouting out its impressive gunplay and new features like crouch sprinting and dragging downed enemies that add a new twist to the usual Battlefield formula. Battlefield 6 features both a single-player campaign and online multiplayer, but it's the latter that's earning the most praise. \"Battlefield 6 is a return to form, even if it doesn't reach the same highs as the series at its peak,\" wrote Richard Wakeling. \"The campaign is as lackluster as expected, and the multiplayer maps are only ever decent at best, but there's still a chaotic and super-satisfying shooter here that offers multiplayer thrills unlike any other. Even if you're not racking up kills by the dozens, you're still rewarded for contributing in other ways, and you're never too far away from being in the middle of a histrionic Battlefield moment.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Packs, themed decks, and an all-in-one tutorial game called Proving Grounds quickly sold out, and the competitive scene is starting to come into its own with tournaments popping up all over the country. PAX Unplugged served as the launching pad for the game's second set, Spiritforged, which will launch in early 2026. New cards, mechanics, and Champions were debuted during an hour-long panel led by Dave Guskin, the lead designer for Riftbound at Riot Games, and previews of new cards have popped up around the internet since then. We sat down with Dave Guskin at PAX Unplugged to learn more about internal reactions to Riftbound's release, as well as what the team has planned for Spiritforged and beyond. We also have an exclusive card from Spiritforged to reveal, with Guskin giving his thoughts on how this new Champion can best be used in battle. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Lego DC Batman: The Animated Series Batmobile (435 Pieces) $38.49 (was $60) | Retiring Soon See at Amazon Batman: The Complete Animated Series on Blu-ray $28.49 (was $80) See at Amazon Batman fans who grew up watching the awesome early '90s animated series will want to check out Amazon's Black Friday deal on the Lego Batmobile from the show. The 435-piece Batman: The Animated Series Batmobile is on sale for only $38.49 (was $60). This deal is especially notable because Lego is retiring this Batman building set soon. And if you'd like the perfect background noise while piecing together the Batmobile, the Blu-ray box set collecting all 85 episodes is on sale for only $28.49 for Black Friday. Lego DC Batman: The Animated Series Batmobile (435 Pieces) $38.49 (was $60) | Retiring Soon Lego released this particular Batmobile last June alongside a few other sets, including the Batman Mech Armor that's also featured in Amazon's Black Friday Lego sale. The set is technically called Batman with the Batmobile vs. Harley Quinn and Mr. Freeze, so it won't surprise you that it comes with those three characters as minifigures. Harley Quinn wields a comically large hammer, while Mr. Freeze has a functional stud launcher. The Batman minifigure is based on his look in the show and has a molded cape. The Batmobile is over 11 inches long and has removable stud launchers, a seat for one minifigure that is accessed by lifting the cockpit hatch. A detachable exhaust flame element twirls when the wheels spin. It has everything that makes a Batmobile Lego model a playset for young Caped Crusader fans--it's recommended for builders ages 8 and up--but it doubles as a nice display piece thanks to the included 360-degree rotatable stand and information placard that's more commonly seen with Lego models designed for adults. See at Amazon Batman: The Complete Animated Series on Blu-ray $28.49 (was $80) Batman: The Complete Animated Series actually includes even more than just the 85-episode series that ran from 1992-1995. It also comes with all 24 episodes of The New Adventures of Batman, Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, and Batman and Mr. Freeze. Fans should also check out the Blu-ray box set deals for three other animated series: Batman Beyond (1999), The Batman (2004), and the classic Adventures of Batman (1968).

Now, the second beta test has begun, and it appears to be a considerable upgrade over the game's previous state. This work-in-progress build has \"50-60 hours worth of polished content,\"a rebuilt storyline, fresh cutscenes and more according to Hypergryph. The combat has also been refined and there's a new region, Wuling, that's now ripe for exploration. The game casts players as the Endministrator, the leader of Endfield Industries who has no memory of the past. As the Endmin reclaims their life, they fight alongside companions and attempt to explore and exploit the wild planet Talos-II. Much like Satisfactory, players can extract resources from the planet and build factories to fully utilize the materials they have at hand. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

See at Amazon If you've been waiting for a discount on Lego's Pac-Man Arcade, you're in luck: The 2,651-piece retro arcade cabinet model is featured in Amazon's Black Friday 2025 Lego sale. The nostalgic officially licensed Pac-Man Arcade is available for $189 (was $270). The $81 discount is the best deal yet for the Pac-Man Arcade, which launched in June 2023. This extremely cool Lego building set for adults almost always sells for full price, and the few deals we've seen over the past two-plus years have sold out fast. Lego Icons: Pac-Man Arcade (2,651 Pieces) $189 (was $270) Part of the Lego Icons series, Pac-Man Arcade is a brick-built countertop machine model measuring 10 x 7 x 13 inches. Out of all of Lego's gaming system sets, Pac-Man Arcade is probably the most impressive from a design perspective. And it's definitely the coolest when it comes to interactive features. It has a movable four-way joystick, and you can press the two dome buttons. The crank on the side of the cabinet moves Pac-Man through the mechanical maze while Blinky and Clyde chase him. The coin slot uses a light brick that makes it look like the real thing. In addition to the cabinet itself, it comes with buildable Pac-Man, Blinky, and Clyde figures that attach to a stand that connects to the top of the cabinet. Rounding out the set is a minifigure-scale '80s arcade scene, complete with a tiny brick-built Pac-Man cabinet and a gamer minifigure wearing vintage clothes. You can store the scene inside the cabinet by removing the back panel. This also allows you to watch the mechanical components in motion while turning the crank.
