    "description": "It was almost a foregone conclusion, but Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 absolutely crushed it at The Game Awards this year, taking home little polygonal statues for a record-setting number of categories it was nominated for. When the game's director, Guillaume Broche took the stage, he thanked a number of individuals, but he ended his speech by giving a very special thank you to us, the players, not with a speech, but with a rather sizable update for the game that dropped the second he walked on stage to accept the award. Dubbed \"The Thank You Update\", this is no mere costume/weapon set, though there's over a dozen each of those to go find too. This is an all-encompassing update that brings everything from quality-of-life updates--a Picto/Lumina filter, a long-overdue photo mode, and an option to escape from battles, to a completely new area called \"Verso's Drafts,\" with a bunch of new story content, mostly about Verso's childhood, and the final music tracks written by Lorien Testard for the game. You can watch the trailer for it here, but, really, we're very sorry, this is a Jack from Lost situation now; you're gonna have to go back and play. The Thank You Update/patch 1.5.0 is available right now on all platforms. The full patch notes are below: Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The 30% price cut is the best offer yet at any retailer, but the deal probably won't be available for long. Last week, Amazon and Walmart had a limited-time deal that dropped the price to $21.13. Both retailers sold out, and Walmart has yet to restock its inventory. Orders placed today (December 12) are expected to arrive before Christmas. Dark Horse published the hardcover edition of Rosalina's Storybook on November 25. Strangely, it was extremely difficult to preorder a copy from Amazon. For months, restocks at Amazon would disappear in hours, so it's a bit surprising to see such a substantial discount this soon after publication. Revealed alongside Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 for Switch and Switch 2, Rosalina's Storybook has been the No. 1 best-selling new release from Dark Horse since it first appeared on Amazon in September.

Ever since he went viral in 2022 for enthusiastically playing the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 medley on a strange-looking tenor flute, Eustache has been a regular feature of The Game Awards. Each year he seems to get more dedicated airtime during the orchestral section, playing bigger and more unusual flutes. Pedro Eustache playing a strange new flute during the Clair Obscur tribute2025, of course, is no different, with Eustache even getting his own announcement video on The Game Awards' social media pages in the lead up to the show. His appearance in the orchestral section didn't disappoint, with his flute part highlighted through the Death Stranding 2 arrangement, and his part in the Clair Obscur section played on a strange new flute that appears to be made out of PVC pipe.

Orbitals is a two-player co-op adventure, where players step into the roles of Maki and Omura to save their home from a supernatural cosmic storm. Aside from showing off the game's gorgeous '80s anime-inspired visuals, Orbitals' debut trailer also highlights how Maki and Omura will traverse space and work together to solve puzzles. In one example of how the game's co-op will work, the trailer shows one character piloting a spaceship while another operates the ship's turret. Another portion of the trailer highlights one of the duo using a levitating beam to help transport some important piece of a puzzle, while the other navigates a series of dangerous platforms.

    "description": "As The Game Awards 2025 came to a close, we got one more surprise: Wildlight--a team of devs led by folks who previously worked on Titanfall 2 and Apex Legends--announced its new game: Highguard. Not only that, the game will be playable in a few weeks. A gameplay trailer showcased that Highguard leans into Apex Legends' hero shooter formula but takes it in a different direction, opting for an objective-based raid shooter as opposed to a kill-or-be-killed battle royale. The narrative direction of the game is different too, opting for something that looks more high fantasy (like horses, magic, and pet familiars) while still maintaining that science-fiction flair when it comes to the various characters' abilities and firearms. On Steam, Highguard is described as a \"PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent. [Players will battle] rival Warden crews for possession of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure territory in this all-new breed of shooter.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Hold on, let me explain. Game director Guillaume Broche took to the stage at the end of The Game Awards to accept the GOTY trophy on behalf of the team at Sandfall Interactive. While commenting that the outfit--a traditional French garb replete with a black-and-white striped shirt and a red beret--started as a joke and thanking the team, publisher Kepler Interactive, and the cast, Broche had a couple more people in mind to give special thanks to. \"And also, I want to extend [my] thanks to the unsung heroes of this industry,\" he said during his roughly five-minute speech. \"The people who make tutorials on YouTube on how to make a game because we had no idea how to make a game before.

At The Game Awards, the first look at Mega Man's next game was revealed. It's called Mega Man Dual Override, and its retains the side-scrolling action of the original games with updated visuals that pop off the screen. Mega Man Dual Override will arrive in 2027, which dovetails with the 40th anniversary of the original Mega Man that debuted in 1987. The title character is a heroic robot who is able to steal certain powers and abilities from bosses he defeats, allowing him to use them against the other bosses. The games even let players strategize which bosses to go after first to determine the enemies who were vulnerable to his newfound weapons. Six Mega Man games were released on the NES before the series went to the SNES with Mega Man 7 in 1995. The spin-off series, Mega Man X, also debuted on the SNES, and the franchise continued in various forms through 2018 and the debut of Mega Man 11. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
