    "title": "Pricey WoW Transmog Changes Have Players Angry And Confused",
    "description": "World of Warcraft's upcoming Midnight expansion is bringing sweeping changes to the MMORPG's transmog system, but they look to be far more expensive than players were led to believe. Earlier this year when Midnight was fully revealed, developer Blizzard announced it would be overhauling the game's cosmetic outfit system in a way that would save players gold. Instead of having to pay gold to transmog individual gear pieces, players would instead transmog gear slots. That slot would then retain its appearance regardless of whatever item was equipped, useful as players level up and equip new gear over the course of an expansion or season. Sounds good on paper. However, the system is now testable on the WoW: Midnight beta, and as broken down by Wowhead, players are discovering these supposedly cost-saving changes are actually extremely expensive.

    "title": "Arc Raiders Patch Notes Include Venator Nerf And A Duck Surprise",
    "description": "Embark Studios has released the patch notes for the latest Arc Raiders update, which details map adjustments, a nerf for the powerful Venator, and ammo changes. It also includes a welcomed surprise for duck collectors. The most notable change in this Arc Raiders update is the nerf to the game's powerful Venator pistol. The developer says it was aware that the fully upgraded Venator was over-performing and \"capable of outgunning full squads using close-range weapons.\" The gun's nerf includes a reduction to the fire rate gained from upgrades, and it also receives an increase in weight. The developer says the weapon's weight was not previously in line with the other pistols in the game, so the weight was increased from 2 to 5. Another major nerf in the update affects the game's powerful Deadline mine. Players have been taking down the game's largest Arc enemies with the Deadline mines, and the developer seems to think it's been too easy to utilize, as the update makes it harder to obtain the mines. The buy value of the Deadline has been increased from 8,100 to 15,000 Coins, the crafting materials needed have also increased, and traders will now carry less stock of the mine.
