Speaking to Chris Evans (not the actor) for his Virgin Radio UK Breakfast Show on November 26 (as spotted by PC Gamer), Houser was asked about his gaming origins, the founding of Rockstar Games and the creation of Grand Theft Auto, and his new sci-fi thriller novel A Better Paradise. During the nearly 30-minute chat, Evans questioned Houser about the technodystopia he laid out in A Better Paradise and whether AI is as amazing as C-suite executives want us to think it is. Houser isn't fully convinced. \"I personally don't think it will because AI is going to eventually eat itself,\" Houser said. \"As far as I understand it--which is really a superficial understanding--the models scour the internet for information, but the internet is going to get more and more full of information made by the models. So, it's sort of like when we fed cows with cows and got mad cow disease. I can't see how the information will get better if they're running out of data. [AI] will do some tasks brilliantly, but it's not going to do every task brilliantly, and it's going to become this sort of mirror of itself.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

In a new interview, IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak stated that news on the series will be revealed in due time, alongside details on the upcoming co-op mode for World of Assassination. \"Of course, there will be more Hitman,\" Abrak said to Variety. \"But right now, I think we need to get to the other side of this year, and next year you'll get more news about Hitman co-op, because I think co-op is a really, really good extension to the universe and will introduce very interesting mechanics and combinations in World of Assassination. But we will after that be talking about the next Hitman--because, of course, there’s going to be a next Hitman.\" IO Interactive's upcoming James Bond game--007: First Light--launches in March 2026. Hitman: World of Assassination has received substantial post-launch support while the studio worked on its 007 game, with the most recent being a new Elusive Target mission that teams Agent 47 up with Eminem to kill the rapper's dangerous alter ego, Slim Shady.

The reported figure comes from prolific Fortnite leaker Shiina, who shared the number in an X post on Sunday. The new season, subtitled \"Pacific Break,\" began Saturday, bringing a completely different battle royale map, along with new weapons and a battle pass. This comes off the tail end of the Chapter 6 \"Zero Hour\" finale, which attracted 10.5 million players in-game and over 3 million viewers through livestreaming, according to Epic Games. The publisher unironically shared the Martin Scorsese \"cinema\" meme in celebration of these figures. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "There's still no release date or window for The Witcher 4. But that's not stopping CD Projekt Red from stating again that a whole new trilogy might launch within a six-year timespan. That's been the plan for years, but the company reasserted this position during a recent financial call, according to Eurogamer. CD Projekt co-CEO Michal Nowakowski was asked about the company utilizing Unreal Engine 5 for The Witcher 4 and whether that could lead to shorter development cycles for future sequels. \"In a way, yes, I do believe that further games should be delivered in a shorter period of time--as we had stated before, our plan still is to launch the whole trilogy within a six-year period, so yes, that would mean we would plan to have a shorter development time between [The Witcher 4] and [The Witcher] 5, between [The Witcher] 5 and [The Witcher] 6 and so on,\" Nowakowski said. Nowakowski's co-CEO at CD Projekt, Adam Kicinski, discussed this six-year timespan for the new Witcher trilogy in 2022--over three years ago. To be clear, the clock would start ticking on six years once The Witcher 4 launches, and that won't happen until 2027 at the earliest. If, for example, The Witcher 4 did come out then, that would mean CD Projekt aims for The Witcher 5 to hit in 2030 and The Witcher 6 in 2033. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "The debate over using generative AI art in media such as television show intros and background art in games has escalated over the past few years. A number of players have recently accused Epic Games of using generative AI for art in Fortnite, but things may be less easy to spot than some of them thought. In the wake of Epic's CEO thinking that AI labeling should be done away with, fans pointed out a few alleged instances in Chapter 7. There's a poster for the Mile High Retreat, showing a Yeti napping in a hammock with the caption \"relax faster, relax higher.\" Looking closer, though, the Yeti appears to have four toes on one foot and five toes on the other. Misnumbered digits are usually an indicator that something was AI-generated. \"So I'm pretty much done with Fortnite,\" one player posted on Bluesky. \"There were statements made by Tim Sweeney saying that AI usage doesn't need to be disclosed, and then AI usage was found all over this current season, from art to sprays to in-game songs.\" They posted three more instances of AI usage; however, one of them was proven to have been done by a human artist.
