Cain also shared an update about his personal life and a new friendship with a squirrel. In a YouTube video, Cain said he recently relocated from Seattle to southern California, and one of the first things that happened was a squirrel ran up to him with no fear. \"She just sat there and looked at me, and I shrugged and I'm like, 'What do you want from me? I don't know you.'\" Cain fed the critter some walnuts and continues to feed the creature every day when he leaves and comes back home. This is how Cain started the video, before getting into his return to Obsidian. He said he's now back at the studio, in-person and full-time. While he has returned to Obsidian, you'll also see his name appear in the credits of an upcoming unspecified game that he did contract work for before coming back to Obsidian, he said.

Suda added that the release date could be delayed by up to two weeks if the master copy of the game is rejected up to three times, which would result in Romeo Is A Dead Man launching around the same time as \"that title with a big nine\" on its box art. Suda is likely referring to Resident Evil Requiem, which launches on February 27 next year. Suda said that it was looking to avoid facing off against some stiff competition.

    "description": "When it was released in 2023, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora succeeded in the daunting task of bringing its own kind of life to the world of James Cameron's Avatar movies. Developer Massive Entertainment wisely chose not to retell the story of the films, instead weaving a tale on the other side of the moon of Pandora where the films take place. But while Frontiers excelled at turning the dense, visually fascinating world of Pandora into a cogent, interactive space and exploring the culture of the Na'vi peoples who populate it, the game also felt somewhat disconnected from the movies. With the release of the third Avatar movie, Avatar: Fire and Ash, Massive is taking the opportunity to adjust that situation a bit. Alongside the movie hitting theaters comes From the Ashes, an expansion for the game that tells a new story that incorporates major elements from the film, while also shaking up Frontiers' take on Pandora in some very big ways. Massive worked closely with Cameron's production company, Lightstorm Entertainment, to bring the stories of the movie and the game a little closer together. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Released last fall, this limited-edition box set has only been discounted to this low of a price once before--and that was six months ago. Samurai Champloo's production was led by legendary anime director Shinichiro Watanabe, who is best known for directing Cowboy Bebop. If you don't yet own Cowboy Bebop on Blu-ray, you have a few great options right now, including the standard Blu-ray for only $26 (was $60) and the Walmart-exclusive Steelbook Edition for $66.65. Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo are widely considered two of the best anime of all time. Samurai Champloo isn't the only Watanabe series on sale for its best price yet on Blu-ray. Space Dandy: The Complete Series is discounted to only $42 (was $70) at Amazon. We've rounded up more great Cyber Week anime deals at the bottom of this story, including Akira on 4K Blu-ray for only $12 and the 4K Steelbook Edition for $19. See all anime deals at Amazon Samurai Champloo: The Complete Series Limited Edition $54 (was $90) Samurai Champloo: The Complete Series Limited Edition is a 3-disc set featuring all 26 episodes that aired on Adult Swim in 2004-2005. The episodes are upscaled to 1080p and are presented in their original 16:9 aspect ratio. The set comes with a stylish display case, six art cards, and the three discs even have concept art printed on the labels. Special features include promotional videos, trailers, an image gallery, concept art, and textless opening/closing credit sequences. Like Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo blends striking visuals, meticulously animated fight scenes, and contemporary music to create an anime that is oozing with style. For Samurai Champloo, Watanabe opted for the jazzy beats and street fashion aesthetics of underground hip-hop. The show is set in alternate Edo-era Japan and follows the young waitress Fuu and her two unlikely companions--the outlaw Mugen and the ronin Ji--on an adventure to find a mysterious samurai who smells of sunflowers. Samurai Champloo often ranks high on lists of the best anime--though admittedly not quite as high as Bebop. Nevertheless, it's well worth picking up while it's on sale. See at Amazon Cowboy Bebop: The Complete Series (Blu-ray) $27 (was $60) Widely considered one of, if not, the best anime series of all time, Cowboy Bebop is a sci-fi western about bounty hunters Spike and Jet, who eke out a living chasing down targets across the solar system. Throughout the series, their crew expands to include the femme fatale Faye Valentine, young hacker Ed, and a super-genius Welsh Corgi named Ein. As the ragtag group completes various jobs on behalf of shadowy clients, they eventually find themselves entangled in a multi-planetary conspiracy. If you're looking to grab the series on Blu-ray, you have two budget-friendly options at major retailers. The cheapest version is the 4-disc Complete Series that launched in 2014. You can get this one for only $27, which is a steal considering the quality of Cowboy Bebop. The standard edition includes the following special features: Memo From Bebop: The Dub Sessions Remembered Dinner Aboard the Bebop Ein's Summer Vacation \"Tank!\" Music Clips Textless Opening and Ending Songs The 25th Anniversary Special Edition is available for $35 and includes a bonus disc with the content listed above as well as the following new features: 25th Anniversary Retrospective 6 Audio Commentary Sessions 20th Anniversary Interview with Koichi Yamadera (voice of Spike Spiegel) Interview with Wendee Lee Interview with Cartoon Network producer Sean Akins Aside from the extra bonuses and different packaging, these Blu-ray sets are otherwise identical. All Blu-ray editions of Cowboy Bebop collect all 26 episodes, remastered in high definition while retaining their original 4:3 aspect ratio, and the option watch with English or Japanese audio. If you want to truly complete your Cowboy Bebop collection, Cowboy Bebop: The Movie is available for $20 at Amazon. This Blu-ray edition is a region-free import. See at Amazon Cowboy Bebop: The Complete Series Steelbook Edition (Blu-ray) $66.65 | Walmart Exclusive Big Cowboy Bebop fans may want to pick up the wonderfully designed Limited Edition Steelbook.

Pokemon Pokopia is an open-world game where players build a utopia for wild pocket monsters. The game launches on March 5, 2026. and preoders are available now for $70 at Amazon, Walmart, and several other retailers. Players who preorder the game will also receive an in-game Ditto rug for their Pokopia world. Pokemon Pokopia (Switch 2) $70 | Releases March 5, 2026 First revealed in September 2025, Pokemon Pokopia is set in a world where humanity has vanished and looks inspired by games like Minecraft, Animal Crossing, and Dragon Quest Builders. One peculiar Ditto returns to find the land withered, and its only remaining resident is a Tangrowth, known simply as Professor Tangrwoth. Using its transformation powers to pass itself off as a human, the Ditto works to restore the land and inspire other Pokemon to return. Players won't just be limited to one island, as the Ditto can transform into a Lapras or Dragonite to reach new locations. Crafting also plays a big role in Pokemon Pokopia, as collected materials can be fashioned into tools and infrastructure to improve buildings and complete quests. See at Amazon See at Walmart See at Best Buy Pokemon Pokopia will be the first Nintendo-published game for Switch 2 to be released as a Game Key Card. This means the physical cartridge will serve as an authentication device, and you'll still need to download the full game to your console. It is worth noting that Game Key Cards are not tied to your console, so you can resell them in the future if you choose to. The game will take up roughly 10GBs of space--so if you're planning to buy the game, you'll want to consider picking up a microSD Express card to increase your storage capacity. Luckily, Amazon currently has a great deal on the Samsung P9 512GB card. Normally $100, this is on sale for $75 while stocks last. Amazon has also restocked the Switch 2 Mario Kart bundle and is matching Walmart's deal price of $449 (was $500), in case you're looking to get a Switch 2 for the festive season.
