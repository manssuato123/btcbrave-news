    "description": "Path of Exile 2 players won't have to wait long for the next update. The Last of the Druids is arriving on December 12, and it's putting more than just the magic of the Druids at your command. Players will soon be able to transform their Druids into a wolf, a bear, or even a dragon-like wyvern. The teaser trailer below demonstrates the powers that each new form has to offer. The Druid's ability to transform is tied to one of three different talismans. As a wolf, players can summon a pack to attack enemies or rip adversaries to shreds with their own teeth and claws. Bears are raw power personified, and they can increase their strength through each roar they make. Becoming a wyvern grants the player the power of flight, as well lightning and fire attacks that can bring any adversary to their knees. Even as a human, Druids have formidable abilities to fall back upon. They can command earth and storm elements, which put thunder and volcano attacks at their fingertips. There will be two paths for Druids to ascend to. As a Shaman, Druid magic and spells are amplified to a staggering degree. The Oracle may be the second ascendancy class for the Druids, but it grants players the foresight to predict enemy movements before they happen. Using those visions of the future in battle sounds like it could be very useful. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

On November 28, Keighley posted the tex \"regal.inspiring.thickness\" along with an image of some kind of huge carving featuring humanoid people in the middle of a desert. On November 29, Keighley followed up with a Google Maps image showing the location of the marketing monolith in the California desert. People quickly found the spot and posted images and video, including the ones below. Then on December 5, Keighley posted yet another teaser, this one also very puzzling.

    "description": "Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is intended as both a continuation and a new start for the long dormant franchise. Though Nintendo has never quite said it overtly, it has seemed likely that this is meant to launch a new series of Prime games--possibly even a second trilogy, for the sake of dramatic rhyme. And the ending of Prime 4 accents that feeling, leaving the door wide open for more story--but in the process, diminishing the character of protagonist Samus Aran. Spoilers for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond follow. As many eager Metroid fans know from preview coverage and reviews, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond features a wide cast of Federation characters, who have been stranded on Viewros with Samus. As you explore the corners of Sol Valley you eventually meet five in total: engineer Myles MacKenzie, sniper Reger Tokabi, Sergeant Ezra Duke, Private Nora Armstrong, and mech unit VUE-995. Each talks with Samus and relates to her in different ways. Myles is out of his element and needs Samus' rescue. Armstrong is a bona fide Samus superfan. Tokabi opens up to her about his religion and upbringing. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

But Nvidia's success was far from guaranteed. CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang recalled recently how a $5 million gift following a failed business deal with Sega gave the company the lifeline it needed at the time, allowing the fledgling company to stay in business and eventually become what it is today. Appearing on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Huang talked about how, back in the 1990s, he and his two co-founders were trying to drum up business for their start-up PC company. They traveled to Japan and pitched Sega management on the idea that Nvidia could build the company's Dreamcast console. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

However, fan backlash against the alleged AI elements in Bullet Paradise have led Running With Scissors to cancel the game entirely. \"After revealing Postal: Bullet Paradise, a title Running With Scissors was planning on publishing--but not developing--we've been overwhelmed with negative responses from our concerned Postal Community,\" said Running With Scissors founder Vince Desi in a statement. \"The strong feedback from them is that elements of the game are very likely AI-generated and thus has caused extreme damage to our brand and our company reputation.\" Desi noted that Running With Scissors has lost trust in Goonswarm Games, which is why the project has now been killed. Subsequently, Goonswarm Games issued a statement to PC GamesN in which the studio denies using AI in either the game or the trailer shown above. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Developed in collaboration with Joya Studios, the Vice candle comes in a frosted white glass with the Rockstar Games logo and has notes of lemon California, yerba mate, thyme, fig leaf, petitgrain, orange oil, and terpenes. Your nose may also notice notes of tuberose, mimosa, jasmine petals, lily, lotus, cyclamen, wild grass, and raspberry blossom. Beyond those, the candle also contains notes of Texas Cedarwood, galbanum, and smoked patchouli. All the new Rockstar products for the holidays.There is also a \"Liberty\" candle that comes in a frosted black glass with notes of blood orange, black pepper, green cardamom, cedar, and clove leaves.
