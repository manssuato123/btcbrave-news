On Metacritic (a GameSpot sister site), Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is currently sitting at a 32 metascore. That means \"generally unfavorable,\" and of the 15 reviews so far, only one is positive. That review, from RogerEbert.com, called it \"thoughtful and smart enough to warrant your attention.\" Meanwhile, the Associated Press review says the sequel has \"no real horror and no real awareness that it should.\" That's a more widespread sentiment among critics. The scary-bad review scores aren't new for the Five Nights at Freddy's film franchise, which is based on the popular video game series. For instance, the first movie sports a 33 metascore, barely above Five Nights at Freddy's 2. That didn't stop the original film from earning roughly $291 million in 2023, per BoxOfficeMojo. Plus, in comparison, the user score was a 7.7, showcasing a wide split between critics and general audiences. That will be something to keep an eye on for Five Nights at Freddy's 2.

Evidence, fans believe, stems from datamined information from the Nintendo Today app, which shares daily bite-sized pieces of news and offers several themes based on various Nintendo franchises. A new Donkey Kong theme came to the app recently, and per datamines (which you can see on Mario Wiki), it looks like the app will highlight a character that had a surprise appearance in Donkey Kong Bananza.

I don't know you.'\" Cain fed the critter some walnuts and continues to feed the creature every day when he leaves and comes back home. This is how Cain started the video, before getting into his return to Obsidian. He said he's now back at the studio, in-person and full-time. While he has returned to Obsidian, you'll also see his name appear in the credits of an upcoming unspecified game that he did contract work for before coming back to Obsidian, he said.
