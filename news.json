    "description": "Shooters are having a moment in 2025, with Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders topping the charts and attracting large player counts as the year comes to an end. The former title is a return to form for a legacy franchise, while the latter leads the charge for the fledgling extraction-shooter genre. Left in the dust in the shooter space, however, is Splitgate 2, a game that its makers thought would revitalize a genre they saw as growing stale. Developer 1047 Games released the first-person shooter in May, exuding extreme confidence in its product. Splitgate 2 tried to bank on nostalgia for old-school arena shooters, directly invoking Halo and even Titanfall. Yet, the game was also marred by contradictory decisions, adapting present-day monetization models and industry-wide fads like battle royale modes. Splitgate 2 is a blip in the big picture of 2025, but the issues and drama surrounding the title and its release were so prolific that the game is certain to be the subject of YouTube essays and analysis for years to come. From microtransaction controversies to studio CEO Ian Proulx donning the most egregious headwear possible in a livestreamed industry event, along with developer layoffs and an extremely unusual \"unlaunching\" of the game, 2025 was nothing but tumultuous for the Splitgate team.

But how can it be so sure? Speaking to GameSpot, CEO Swen Vincke explained that the D&amp;D tabletop roots of Baldur's Gate 3 could actually make things more difficult. \"One of the biggest struggles that we had with Baldur's Gate 3 is every single class has almost different rulesets, so getting players on board with that was quite complicated,\" Vincke told us. While those with D&amp;D experience (or a similar game like Solasta) may have felt like they were ready for Baldur's Gate 3 at launch, it does feature a number of class-unique mechanics that people have to learn. These range from the Barbarian's \"rage\" mechanic to the spell-slots system for magic-users, and it definitely puts D&amp;D veterans at something of an advantage. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Speaking to Bloomberg, Larian boss Swen Vincke said its developers use generative AI tools for things like exploring new game ideas, developing concept art, creating placeholder text, and for PowerPoint presentations. Vincke said, \"I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we're using it.\" That said, Bloomberg reported that there has been \"some pushback at Larian.\" He also confirmed that the new Divinity game will not have any AI-generated content in it. \"Everything is human actors; we're writing everything ourselves,\" he said.

He was the original creative director on Rainbow Six Siege and comes back to Ubisoft alongside Alex Parizeau, the former managing director of Ubisoft Toronto. March of Giants is a 4v4 tactical multiplayer free-to-play MOBA inspired by technology from the early 1900s. The game combines elements of real-time strategy and lane-based combat. It's called March of Giants because players take on the role of a giant who is controlling troops on the battlefield.

    "description": "Germany's defense ministry is now funding tests to see if hissing cockroaches from Madagascar can be used as reconnaissance drones on the battlefield. It sounds like something out of a futuristic military video game, like Call of Duty. The defense ministry has announced that it's funding research and development at SWARM Biotactics to create technology that can \"steer cockroaches and send them on reconnaissance missions,\" CBS News reported. CEO Stefan Wilhelm said the cockroaches are \"super resilient\" and can crawl through \"tiny spaces,\" climb up walls, go into pipes, and navigate through rubble. How does this work? Neuroscientists at the company put electrodes on the critters' antennae to \"stimulate the insects' natural ability to navigate.\" They wear little backpacks carrying batteries and chips, with the bugs controlled through a game-style joystick. The researchers claim the cockroaches are not hurt by any of this. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
