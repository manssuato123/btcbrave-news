    "description": "Tekken development chief Katsuhiro Harada has announced that he'll be departing from the fighting game series and its publisher Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. Harada--who has worked on every Tekken game since the series first debuted in 1994--said in a social media post that the death of close friends in his life had led to him to consider how much time he had left as a creator, and after consulting PlayStation icon Ken Kutaragi, he decided to leave the publisher after spending 30 years working on the Tekken franchise. \"With the Tekken series reaching its 30th anniversary--an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to--I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close,\" Harada wrote in an online post. \"In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect. Those accumulated events made me reflect on the 'time I have left as a creator.' During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi--whom I respect as though he were another father--and received invaluable encouragement and guidance. His words quietly supported me in making this decision.\" I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025.With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.My roots lie… — Katsuhiro Harada (@Harada_TEKKEN) December 8, 2025 Harada added that he'd been gradually preparing the Tekken team for his departure, and he was grateful to have worked on the series and on several other games, such as Pokken Tournament and SoulCalibur. While Harada is leaving Bandai Namco, he mentioned he would share his next steps at a later date. In a separate post, Bandai Namco said it remains committed to future development and content for Tekken 8 and expressed gratitude to Harada for his decades of work. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Studios. Now, a new report suggests that Netflix once considered buying EA and two other movie studios before the Warner Bros. negotiations came together. According to Bloomberg, Netflix executives previously debated whether the streamer should place bids for EA, Fox, and Disney. However, the management team reportedly couldn't agree on a deal and feared that its interest in those companies would hurt its standing with investors. The report doesn't include the details about when Netflix considered these acquisitions, especially since Disney is usually the company that buys other studios including Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. Disney purchased Fox's entertainment assets in 2019 following an extended approval process from government agencies around the world. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

While it's still unclear what exactly the statue is promoting, CI Games CEO Marek Tyminski has confirmed that it's not Lords of the Fallen 2. When the statue was first revealed, the most popular guesses for what it was marketing included Diablo, a new God Of War title, Elder Scrolls 6, or Lords of the Fallen 2. Tyminski posted about the monolith on X to confirm that it was not the latter, saying he was \"flattered\" people thought the stunt might have come from CI Games, but his studio is not at that level just yet. Flattered so many think we’re behind that statue 😅 Can confirm it’s not us, we’re just as hyped as you are. Devs are praying it’s something FROM.

    "title": "Five Nights At Freddy's 2 Defies Poor Reviews With Big Opening Weekend",
    "description": "Last week, the early word on Five Nights At Freddy's 2 from critics was overwhelmingly negative, with only 12% on Rotten Tomatoes. It didn't matter to moviegoers, however, as audiences showed up to theaters to check out the sequel anyway. According to Deadline, Five Nights At Freddy's 2 had a $63 million opening weekend in the United States and Canada, and $46 million internationally against a reported $36-$51 million budget. That gave the film a $109 million global opening. The first Five Nights At Freddy's had a higher opening in 2023 with $80 million domestically, despite being released in tandem with the film's streaming premiere on Peacock. Regardless, this sequel's opening was big enough to kick Disney's Zootopia 2 out of the No. 1 slot after only a single weekend. It also earned Five Nights At Freddy's 2 a few box office records, including biggest opening for a post-Thanksgiving weekend, biggest December opening for a horror film, and the biggest December opening for Universal Pictures. Additionally, Five Nights At Freddy's 2 now has the third-highest grossing opening weekend for a PG-13 horror movie, behind only the original Five Nights At Freddy's and World War Z, which had $80 million and $66.4 million, respectively.

Evangelion: 1.11 on Blu-ray is down to only $20, its lowest price since being reissued alongside Evangelion: 2.22 ($24) in October. Both films had been out of print in the US for years. The DVD version of Evangelion: 2.22 is discounted to just $14. Evangelion: 3.33 on DVD is on sale for $19.49 (was $30). Unfortunately, this is the only one you can't buy on Blu-ray--unless you're willing to pay a hefty premium for the out-of-print 2016 edition. the DVD edition comes with a booklet and slipcover, so it's not all bad news.

    "title": "Asus ROG Xbox Ally Gets $110 Discount At Amazon",
    "description": "Asus ROG Xbox Ally Gaming Handheld $490 (was $600) Get deal at Amazon See at Walmart See at Best Buy See at Target The Asus ROG Xbox Ally is on sale for its lowest price yet at Amazon. Normally $600, the official Xbox gaming handheld is up for grabs for only $490 for a limited time. It's unclear when this deal ends, but you'll also find the recently released handheld on sale at Walmart ($499), Best Buy ($500), and Target ($550). This isn't the first time the Xbox Ally has received a discount. On November 29, Best Buy and Amazon discounted the device to $500. That deal was only available for three hours as a Black Friday flash deal, so it was easy to miss. If you pick up the Xbox Ally at Amazon, you should also check out some of the third-party accessories available now, including docking stations, screen protectors, travel cases, and microSD UHS-II cards. Asus ROG Xbox Ally Gaming Handheld $490 (was $600) The ROG Xbox Ally is an entry-level Windows gaming handheld with impressive features and performance for the price. The Ryzen Z2 A chip is comparable to Steam Deck's custom AMD APU, and if you increase the TDP--at the expense of battery life--the Xbox Ally can outperform the Steam Deck OLED. For reference, the Steam Deck OLED 512GB model retails for $549. The Xbox Ally has a 1920 x 1080p IPS display with 120Hz refresh rate and support for VRR and AMD FreeSync Premium. If you're comparing to the Steam Deck OLED, Valve's handheld has a 7.4-inch 1280 x 800p OLED display with HDR and 90Hz refresh rate. So the Steam Deck wins in panel type and size, but the Xbox Ally wins in resolution and refresh rate. That said, to get the best performance on Xbox Ally, you will often want to lock the resolution at 720p, so the Xbox Ally doesn't always take full advantage of its advantages. The Xbox Ally is arguably the most comfortable Windows gaming handheld on the market today. Asus opted for the PlayStation Portal approach by essentially splitting the Xbox Wireless Controller in half and connecting it to each side. Along with all of the buttons, triggers, and bumpers found on the Xbox Wireless Controller, the Xbox Ally has two remappable back buttons. It also has motion controls and HD haptics. One of the big selling points of the Xbox Ally is the custom, console-inspired dashboard that is easier to use than the traditional Windows interface. The Xbox Ally has a 512GB SSD, 16GB RAM, a microSD UHS-II card slot to expand storage capacity, two USB-C ports, and a headphone jack. Check out the Xbox Ally's specs and features below. If you want to read more about the Xbox Ally and the higher-powered $1,000 Xbox Ally X, check out our buying guide and our review of the Ally X. Specs: Processor: AMD Ryzen Z2 A RAM: 16GB LPDDR5X-6400 Storage: 512GB M.2 2280 SSD Display: 7\" IPS touchscreen (Gorilla Glass Victus) 1920 x 1080 120Hz refresh rate VRR supported AMD FreeSync Premium Controller Design: Contoured grips Hall Effect triggers Shoulder bumpers ABXY bumpers 2 remappable back buttons Analog sticks with light rings 6-Axis motion controls HD haptics 5 menu/settings buttons Ports: 2x USB 3.2 Type-C 3.5mm audio microSD: UHS-II reader (only UHS-II) Network: Wi-Fi 6E / Bluetooth 5.4 Battery: 80Wh Battery life: 1.5-5 hours Weight: 670g Dimensions: 290.8 x 121.5 x 50.7mm Get deal at Amazon See at Walmart See at Best Buy Game Pass Ultimate subscribers have a built-in library of hundreds of games for the Xbox Ally. Whether you already have a subscription or not, you'll want to purchase your membership from a major retailer instead of directly through Microsoft. The price of Game Pass Ultimate increased to $30/month in October, but major retailers still sell prepaid codes for $20/month. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
