    "title": "New Lego Star Wars BB-8 Droid Building Set Is Available Now",
    "description": "Lego Star Wars: BB-8 Astromech Droid (569 Pieces) $90 See at Amazon See at Lego Store Lego has kicked off 2026 by adding several notable Star Wars models to its ever-expanding catalog. The lineup of January 2026 Lego Star Wars sets features notable starships and transport vehicles like the Venator-Class Attack Cruiser and AT-AT Walker as well as the return of the most popular droid from the recent Star Wars film trilogy. That's right, BB-8 has returned to the Star Wars Lego lineup following a lengthy hiatus. The 569-piece BB-8 Astromech Droid is available now for $90 at Amazon, the Lego Store, and other major retailers. See all new Lego sets at: Lego Store | Amazon Lego Star Wars New Releases (January 2026) Here's a list of all eight brand-new Star Wars Lego sets as well as the massive UCS Death Star, which is no longer exclusive to the Lego Store. The AT-AT Walker and Venator-Class Attack Cruiser are part of the Lego Star Wars mid-scale display model series for adults. AT-AT Walker (525 pieces) -- $65 BB-8 Astromech Droid (569 pieces) -- $90 Venator-Class Attack Cruiser (643 pieces) -- $80 UCS Death Star (9,023 pieces) -- $1,000 Clone Shock Trooper Mech (151 pieces) -- $15 Cobb Vanth's Speeder (207 pieces) -- $35 The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu's Speeder Bike (58 pieces) -- $10 Grogu's Homestead (107 pieces) -- $20 Siege of Mandalore Battle Pack (116 pieces) -- $23 Lego Star Wars: BB-8 Astromech Droid (569 Pieces) $90 The 569-piece BB-8 buildable figure looks like a great recreation of the lovable Astromech Droid from the Star Wars Sequel Trilogy. The model comes with a display plaque and information card. A small BB-8 figure connects to the end of the stand. Interactive features include an openable front hatch with a burner arm in his chest cavity, just like in The Force Awakens, and a movable head that rotates in random directions when you slide BB-8 across a flat surface. Just be aware that this BB-8 model is much smaller than the one Lego released back in 2017. The new BB-8 (model No. 75452) is just over 3 inches tall, whereas the 1,106-piece build (model No. 75187) was over 10 inches tall. On the positive side, the smaller-sized BB-8 is a more detailed replica of the droid. Plus, there's a practical reason for this BB-8 to be smaller. Lego designed BB-8 to be accurate in terms of scale when compared to other buildable droids released over the past two years, including R2-D2, C-3PO, and Chopper. See at Amazon See at Lego Store Lego Star Wars: R2-D2 - 25th Anniversary Edition (1,050 Pieces) $80 (was $100) See at Amazon See at Target Sold out at Target Sold out at Walmart Full price at Best Buy Backordered at Lego Continue Reading at GameSpot",

After selling out in the lead-up to Christmas, the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Minifigure 6-Pack is back in stock for $30 at Amazon. Resellers have been selling Spider-Verse mystery boxes for around $50, so Amazon will probably sell out again soon. If you're interested in collecting this Lego minifigure series, now's the time to grab a box or two. Spider-Verse minifigures are sold out at all other major retailers and the Lego Store. Most retailers sold out shortly after the collection launched in September and never restocked the mystery boxes or singles. And with the Lego Minifigure Animal Series 28 Collection launching this week, it's unlikely the Spider-Verse minifigures stick around for much longer. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Tom and Jerry: The Golden Era Anthology (Blu-ray) $46.79 (was $60) Get deal at Amazon Tom and Jerry: The Golden Era Anthology is on sale for a nice discount at Amazon. The newly released Blu-ray collection is up for grabs for $46.79 (was $60). The Golden Era Anthology compiles over 100 classic animated shorts starring the iconic duo. The six-disc box set also comes with a wealth of bonus features and a physical sketchbook. The Golden Era Anthology is also available on DVD for $46.79 (was $55), though it doesn't include the bonus content disc or sketchbook. Warner Bros. released The Golden Era Anthology on December 2 to celebrate Tom and Jerry's 85th anniversary. Unsurprisingly, this awesome collection quickly became a bestseller when preorders opened in September. Though Amazon's store page notes a $60 MSRP, the retailer has listed the collection for as high as $66.49. Amazon previously offered the $46.79 deal in mid-December, but it disappeared within a day. Tom and Jerry: The Golden Era Anthology (Blu-ray) $46.79 (was $60) Part of the Warner Archive Collection, The Golden Era Anthology features 114 theatrical shorts across six discs. The shorts were restored in 1080p resolution and support DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0. Three of the shorts have stereo audio, while the rest are mono. The box set collects nearly 20 years of Tom and Jerry history. The animated shorts, which played before feature films, originally appeared in theaters from 1940 through 1958. All 114 shorts are presented in chronological order, and three of them--Casanova Cat, Mouse Cleaning, and His Mouse Friday--were completely remastered for the first time. The Golden Era Anthology's sixth disc is loaded with bonus content, including audio commentaries narrated by animation experts, featurettes, and extra shorts. Two of the featurettes are exclusive to this release: Lady of the House: The Story of Mammy Two Shoes and Animal Hijinks: The Friends and Foes of Tom. The included physical sketchbook features archival character art and designs. Special Features 20 audio commentaries 9 classic featurettes 2 new featurettes 3 bonus animated shorts 32-page sketchbook All told, The Golden Era Anthology includes approximately 20 hours of content. The cover art features Tom in his Zoot suit from the 1944 animated short The Zoot Cat. Get deal at Amazon Tom and Jerry: The Golden Era AnthologyThe Golden Era Anthology is notable for including two remastered shorts that had never received home media releases in the US: Mouse Cleaning and Casanova Cat. These are controversial Tom and Jerry episodes due to them being racially insensitive, and while they were scheduled to appear in Tom and Jerry: The Golden Collection Volume Two, that release was ultimately canceled. Older--and extremely dated--content like this has appeared in several other Warner Archive releases over the years, as the company has added disclaimers to these shorts to indicate their historical context, problematic nature, and racially insensitive jokes.

    "description": "My favorite moment in Skin Deep, an immersive sim and stealth game about rescuing cats and fighting your evil clone in deep space, was always the one immediately after a thoroughly developed plan inevitably went sideways. The skittish way that I was forced to sprint and crawl under a table or into a vent. The manner in which my strategy devolved into simply batting things off of shelves in order to incapacitate a roaming guard or noisily distract them from looking in my direction. The way that I leapt onto a guard's back, dug my claws in, and careened them into surfaces in order to knock them out. If you were to close your eyes, I'd argue you could almost hear that distinctive, feline yowl mid-action. In short, I think Skin Deep best captures the experience of being a cat, even if Nina Pasadena, the game's protagonist, is decidedly not one. And for this tremendous feat, I am rewarding it with the honor of being the best cat game of 2025. Long live Skin Deep. In a typical Skin Deep mission, I often tried to keep to the shadows, as is the norm for a game in its genre. I would relegate myself to the ventilation, the pipework surrounding it, and the undersides of tables. Like Batman, I skulked around the perimeter looking for a precise opening that'd enable me to punch a hole in the level's defenses while keeping my cover. Of course, in Skin Deep, it almost never worked out in my favor. Because I am not, in fact, Batman. I'm just a (cat) girl. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "PlayStation has revealed this month's batch of free games for PlayStation Plus subscribers. All PS Plus members will be able to claim Need For Speed Unbound, Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, and Core Keeper starting January 6 and they will remain available until Monday, February 2. NFS Unbound promo art.The most recent Need for Speed game, NFS Unbound, has single-player and multiplayer campaigns set in Lakeshore City, which greatly resembles Chicago. Street racing is a key part of the experience, but so is outrunning the cops. As your \"Heat\" index rises after each race, the police will pursue players with greater intensity as they establish their rep outside of the law. Between races, players can customize their rides and compete in weekly qualifiers to get into the ultimate street racing contest: The Grand. Mickey unleashes his paint brush in promo art for Epic Mickey: Rebrushed.Epic Mickey was a Wii exclusive upon its 2010 debut until THQ Nordic's 2024 remaster, Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, brought the game to modern consoles. The visuals and gameplay have been noticeably improved as Mickey Mouse is sucked into the Wasteland where forgotten characters and concepts have languished for decades. This game is one of the reasons why Disney made a deal to gain the rights to Walt Disney's previous creation, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. And for the first time, Mickey has to come face-to-face with his brother, Oswald, and reconcile with him if he wants any chance of escaping the Wasteland. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

This deal has been available for about two weeks, so it probably won't be active for much longer. The $33 price is an all-time low for a microSD Express Card from any brand. The 512GB edition, unfortunately, is selling for its full $100 price. Amazon is also still selling the Lexar Play Pro 1TB microSD Express, the most popular 1TB card on the market, for $186 (was $220).

    "title": "This Game With Rocket Trucks, Yakuza, And Sentient Mascots Is 2025's Most Radically Kind And Empathetic Game",
    "description": "Throughout the events of Promise Mascot Agency, I was Pinky's ride. Anywhere that she needed to go, I had to ferry her in my crappy little truck. As a matter of fact, I was responsible for the transport of any and every mascot that stumbled through the doors of the Promise Mascot Agency and came under my employ. When Kofun needed to go to a nearby graveyard, I was the guy for the job. When Trororo needed a lift to the local adult store, I begrudgingly told him to hop in. Be it by land, air, or sea, it became my responsibility, and mine alone, to make sure everyone got where they needed to go. Promise Mascot Agency is a game filled to the brim with chores and mundane tasks like this. As I traveled across the isle of Kaso-Machi, drifting in and out of decrepit villages and farm fields, I found that Promise Mascot Agency's cast was filled with folks in need of some assistance. The English teacher who worked unpaid overtime shifts to put on a night school at her underfunded workplace. The nearby mechanic with an insatiable curiosity for the occult, and no time between his job and family. If a shrine needed to be swept, I was there with a broom in a split second. Whether it was the local barkeep in a gimp suit, the streamer-turned-farmer, or of course, the disenfranchised youth, I was there with an olive branch to extend. Promise Mascot Agency probably sounds like a convoluted game. It is. In one breath, it is a title about an ex-yakuza--handsomely voiced by the same actor behind Kiryu in the Yakuza games--driving around a countryside, rounding up seemingly endless collectibles and upgrades, and sending living mascots (like a giant crying tofu block) out on jobs via a simplistic management system and card-based minigame. In the latter, you must play support cards with differing strengths and weaknesses as a mascot performs a job in order to beat a troubling interference that arises and assure the job is a success. In another breath, it is a full-throated exercise in the lengths of compassion and empathy. It is rarely sleek and sexy about it--Promise Mascot Agency doesn't feature over-the-top set pieces or hide slick new super moves to reward the player for completing its long list of chores. But real, tender empathy for your fellow man rarely does look so good, and Promise Mascot Agency's unglamorous honesty is something I've come to admire from one of 2025's best and brightest games.
