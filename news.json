The 1,048-piece model is 50% off, lowering the price to just $50 (was $100). Amazon first offered this deal on November 13 before the Black Friday sale officially kicked off. Unsurprisingly, Amazon has sold out multiple times over the past week, so the deal is unlikely to remain in stock for very long. Grogue with Hover Pram is one of two official Black Friday Lego deals at Amazon (so far); the other deal is on a nostalgic diorama based on a scene from Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope.

    "description": "Nintendo Switch Black Friday Deals Browse discounts on games, controllers, grip cases, and more. See at Amazon Nintendo's official Black Friday promotion begins this Sunday, November 23, but with sales events running already at Amazon and Best Buy, you already have a massive selection of discounted Switch and Switch 2 games to choose from. If you clicked on this article earlier in the week, you browsed a list of roughly 85 deals on physical games for Switch 1/2. Many of the early Black Friday Switch deals are still available, but they have been joined by so many others. Our list has practically doubled in size, so now Switch and Switch 2 players have around 170 game deals to check out below. And if you haven't already, you may want to bookmark this page, because we'll continue to update this roundup throughout Black Friday and Cyber Week. See Switch deals at Amazon See Switch 2 deals at Amazon See all gaming deals at Amazon See Switch game deals at Best Buy We separated Nintendo Switch 2 and Switch games into two lists, but keep in mind that original Switch games are playable on Nintendo's new console. Some original Switch games have received free or paid Switch 2 upgrades, and others simply run better on the more powerful hardware by default. Black Friday Nintendo Switch 2 Game Deals The Nintendo Switch 2 list is, rather unsurprisingly, significantly shorter than the Switch list, but there are numerous titles on sale for all-time low prices, including recent releases like Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac, Little Nightmares III, Cronos, and Star Wars Outlaws: Gold Edition, which is discounted to $40 (was $60) at Amazon. The sports game deals are even better than earlier in the week, as Madden NFL 26, EA Sports FC 26, and NBA 2K26 are going for $30 (was $70) each. Harry Potter fans can get the Switch 2 version of Hogwarts Legacy for a new all-time low of $45 (was $60). Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Earlier this year, Hytale was canceled after spending a decade in development and the studio behind it, Hypixel, was slated to be closed as well. Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme subsequently revived the company and purchased all of the rights for Hytale from Riot Games. Collins-Laflamme also reiterated his commitment to releasing Hypixel in early access. Now, we know how much the game is going to cost. On social media, Hypixel revealed that Hytale will retail for $20. However, there will be more expensive editions with perks including cosmetics that fans can purchase in support of the team. After confirming the price, Collins-Laflamme noted that this decision puts him financially at risk because he's already committed to bankrolling his company and funding the game out of his own pocket. \"I'm pricing Hytale as aggressively low as possible,\" wrote Collins-Laflamme on X. \"I'm taking on a considerable personal risk after repurchasing the game and getting it ready for early access for a growing team of now 50 talented individuals. I said I was all in, and I am delivering on that promise. The game is unfinished and runs on a build from over four years ago. Charging more didn't feel right. I don't think the game is good yet. My team and I will push hard to make it good, then great. The vision is clear and progress is fast.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "We are fast approaching the end to another Fortnite chapter, and that means it's nearly time for a huge live event that will introduce a new era for Epic Games' metaverse. It's Fortnite's biggest party, typically drawing its biggest concurrent player numbers by a wide margin each year. In 2023 it drew more than 11 million players, and 2024's event pulled more than 14 million. And with this year's chapter finale, titled Zero Hour, looking like it's going to rope in every collab Fortnite had over the past 365 days while also picking up old storylines that Fortnite abandoned years ago, this one's looking like quite a doozie. The Fortnite Chapter 6 finale event looks like it'll be quite a spectacle.When is Fortnite's Chapter 6 finale event going down? The live finale event, which will only take place one time, will begin at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET on Saturday, November 29. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Now, Bethesda is releasing an update for November and looking ahead to a December update as well. Bethesda shared the patch notes on social media. The message didn't directly address the negative response to Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition, but it did thank players for their \"continued communication with us on your current Fallout 4 experience.\" The dev team notes that it's focused on DLC installation issues, occasional crashing, and general user experience in the patch. https://t.co/LHVpZHZ4s0 — Bethesda Game Studios (@BethesdaStudios) November 21, 2025 The team added that it still plans to add a mod storage expansion on Fallout 4's console versions. However, the devs state that more time is needed before that feature is ready to be released. Beyond that, the team promised to share details about the December patch in a few weeks.
