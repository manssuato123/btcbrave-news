Amazon has discounted Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot - Daima Edition to $30 (was $50) for the PS5 version, while the massive fighting game Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero has gotten a 50% discount and is available for $30 on both PS5 and Xbox Series X. Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero $30 (was $60) Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero is the most recent video game release in the franchise, and it's an anime-inspired slugfest with a massive roster of characters pulled from every era of Dragon Ball. Everyone from Goku to Vegeta is included in the game's lineup, and while the combat does have a steep learning curve, once you nail it you'll be throwing out Final Flash and Kamehameha attacks like a pro. The game also looks stunning in action, and if you grew up playing the Dragon Ball Budokai Tenkaichi games, then this will appeal to you as it's a continuation of that series. PS5 -- $30 ($60) Xbox Series X -- $30 ($60) See at Amazon See at Best Buy Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot - Daima Edition $30 (was $50) In comparison, Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is an action-RPG that blends fast-paced fisticuffs with level-grinding. The game also gives you a world to explore as you take part in Goku's greatest battles across the Dragon Ball storyline, and since launch, publisher Bandai Namco has expanded on the game with several story DLC drops inspired by classic OVA series and Dragon Ball Super. The Daima Edition does not include those expansions, but it does come bundled with the two-part Daima DLC, which is based on the Dragon Ball Daima anime series. One thing to note here is that only the first part has been released so far, and Part Two will arrive in early 2026.

It's now pacing ahead of the original Switch by 68% and is also ahead 3% of the PlayStation 4's \"previous record velocity\" for sales. The Switch 2 helped lift US hardware sales in October to $351 million, which was up 36% year-over-year.

    "title": "Elden Ring Nightreign Drops To Just $25 For Black Friday",
    "description": "Elden Ring All Elden Ring games have gotten big Black Friday discounts All Elden Ring Black Friday deals at Amazon Out of all the souls-like games on the market, Elden Ring is considered to be the gold standard for the genre. From Software's masterpiece has sold tens of millions of copies since it was first released a few years ago, and if you've been looking to try it out, this Black Friday deal will get you the game for just $20 (was $40). Its award-winning expansion Shadow of the Erdtree and the spin-off game Elden Ring Nightreign have also received big discounts. Elden Ring $20 (was $50) This isn't the first time that Elden Ring has sold for $20, but the game is very rarely discounted to this low price. Similar to From Software's other souls-likes, Elden Ring is an elegantly grim game set in a land of fantasy, wonder, and danger. Game of Thrones author George RR Martin contributed to its lore and world, and everywhere you go, there's always something to discover in The Lands Between. It's only one of a select few games to earn a rare 10/10 score at GameSpot, as it's a game full of substance and style. If you decide to pick it up for PS5 but that version is sold out, the PS4 edition does offer a free PS5 upgrade. Elden Ring PS5 PS4 Xbox Series X See at Amazon See at Best Buy Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Edition $40 - $50 (was $80) Shadow of the Erdtree isn't just a simple expansion for Elden Ring: It's an essential part of the experience and its grand sweeping narrative. While From Software could have done more of the same and simply called it a day, Shadow of the Erdtree adds an increased amount of new weapons, equipment, skills, and magic that are not found in the original game. Amazon is offering the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Edition for $50 on both PS5 and Xbox Series X, which gets you both Elden Ring and the expansion together in a single bundle. This normally costs $80 on its own and is rarely discounted this much, so this is quite the savings. Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Edition PS5 -- $50 Xbox Series X -- $40 See at Amazon See at Best Buy Elden Ring Nightreign $25-$35 Released earlier this year, Elden Ring Nightreign retains the gameplay that made the original game and its expansion so popular, but it reimagines the experience as a co-op boss rush game set in the land of Limveld--an alternate version of Elden Ring's Limgrave. Gameplay revolves around players teaming up and choosing a boss to fight, leveling up during the day for a brutal showdown at night. Expeditions generally last around 35-45 minutes, making for breezy but enjoyable gameplay sessions. You can get either the standard edition or the Amazon-exclusive edition on sale, with Amazon's version offering additional playable characters and bosses, a digital artbook, mini soundtrack, and a poster of the game's key art, all for an extra $10. \"Elden Ring's DNA is ever-present, but Nightreign is also a game of striking subversions: a From Software game that asks you to play it unconventionally, disregarding meticulous exploration, isolation, and measured combat for a cooperative multiplayer game built on speed and aggression. In many ways, it's the antithesis of what people typically come to From Software games for, and yet somehow, someway, this experimental non-sequel is an absolute triumph,\" Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's Elden Ring: Nightreign review.
