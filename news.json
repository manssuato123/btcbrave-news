Black Friday Video Game Mega Sale Save on video games &amp; hardware through December 2 See All Deals At Woot Amazon is a great spot to find Black Friday deals, but don't miss out on the discounts at Woot. Though it's not as popular, Woot is an Amazon company--meaning you can easily sign in with your Amazon account--and right now it's running the aptly named Video Game Mega Sale. Dozens of games and accessories are on sale until December 2, and we've listed some of our favorites below. However, Woot is offering a Black Friday-exclusive bonus offer for an additional 20% (up to a maximum $40 discount) when purchasing these items through the Woot app on your smartphone until Black Friday ends. You'll see the final discounted price at the very end of the checkout process (no promo code required), so consider downloading the app to save a few extra bucks. Check out our picks for the best Switch, Switch 2, PS5, and gaming accessory deals in Woot's sake below.

    "description": "Battlefield 6 $35 (was $70) See at Amazon Battlefield 6 is on sale for a massive discount for PS5 and Xbox Series X for Black Friday. Amazon is offering a 50% discount on the physical edition, dropping the price from $70 to $35 on both platforms. Battlefield 6 launched October 10, so a 50% discount this soon, especially for a game that was already selling well, is surprising. Amazon has already sold out of this deal at least once, so snag a copy of the new multiplayer FPS while you can. Battlefield 6 $35 (was $70) The Battlefield 6 standard edition includes the base game on your platform of choice. While the game is packed with tons of single-player and multiplayer content, there's also the Battlefield 6 Season Pass available as a separate in-game purchase for those who want to add a bit more personality to their online persona. See at Amazon After a misstep with Battlefield 2042, DICE seems to be back on track with Battlefield 6. Our Battlefield 6 review gave it a 7/10, shouting out its impressive gunplay and new features like crouch sprinting and dragging downed enemies that add a new twist to the usual Battlefield formula. Battlefield 6 features both a single-player campaign and online multiplayer, but it's the latter that's earning the most praise. \"Battlefield 6 is a return to form, even if it doesn't reach the same highs as the series at its peak,\" wrote Richard Wakeling. \"The campaign is as lackluster as expected, and the multiplayer maps are only ever decent at best, but there's still a chaotic and super-satisfying shooter here that offers multiplayer thrills unlike any other. Even if you're not racking up kills by the dozens, you're still rewarded for contributing in other ways, and you're never too far away from being in the middle of a histrionic Battlefield moment.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Riftbound, the League of Legends trading card game, launched in late October to an incredible fan reaction. Packs, themed decks, and an all-in-one tutorial game called Proving Grounds quickly sold out, and the competitive scene is starting to come into its own with tournaments popping up all over the country. PAX Unplugged served as the launching pad for the game's second set, Spiritforged, which will launch in early 2026. New cards, mechanics, and Champions were debuted during an hour-long panel led by Dave Guskin, the lead designer for Riftbound at Riot Games, and previews of new cards have popped up around the internet since then. We sat down with Dave Guskin at PAX Unplugged to learn more about internal reactions to Riftbound's release, as well as what the team has planned for Spiritforged and beyond. We also have an exclusive card from Spiritforged to reveal, with Guskin giving his thoughts on how this new Champion can best be used in battle. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
