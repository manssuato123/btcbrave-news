Players only have a limited time to experience the eerie Crystal Cave and discover its secrets, however, as the AoT quest is only available from November 25 to December 22. The new mission brings protagonists Naoe and Yasuke to the mysterious Crystal Cave, where dark experiments threaten to unleash a new type of threat on feudal Japan. Explore the cave's depths and stop a mysterious cult from turning their kidnapped Titan-Shifter into a major problem. The new quest is available to all players who have unlocked Yasuke as a playable character, and can be unlocked by talking to quest-giver Ada in the Yamashiro region, North of Hanazo Tower. Players will be able to loot new cosmetics for their hideout throughout the quest, and will be rewarded upon completion with a new crystal katana for Naoe. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Now, reports suggest Fortnite's plans with Paramount go beyond just SpongeBob, with \"many\" other Paramount franchises lined up for the battle royale game. Alongside the Simpsons season launch on November 1, Epic introduced the new Sidekicks feature to Fortnite--small pet or minion creatures that follow players around. Regular Fortnite leaker SamLeakss has now reported that \"many\" Paramount-owned characters will soon be coming to the game as Sidekicks. There's no information yet on the characters or series that might be included, but Paramount has a huge roster of popular franchises, with its portfolio including both Nickelodeon and Comedy Central. Some of its biggest series include SpongeBob SquarePants, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Transformers, South Park, Dora the Explorer, and Paw Patrol--though it seems unlikely that the franchises aimed at younger kids will be added to a video game like Fortnite.

    "description": "It's coming up to a decade since Nintendo released Star Fox Zero for the Wii U in 2016. But if Nintendo won't get around to it, someone else has something very similar. Giles Goddard--one of the programmers of the original Star Fox--is working on Wild Blue Skies, a new on-rails sky shooter that looks and feels a lot like his former franchise. IGN debuted the new gameplay video for Wild Blue Skies, which covers the entirety of the second stage, Hurricane. It's enough to give you Star Fox 64 flashbacks as Bowie Stray, an anthropomorphic pilot dog, leads his squadron--Chuck, Roe, and Thorne--into battle during a raging storm. And it gives us enough of the new team's personalities that we can say Thorne is definitely the Slippy Toad of this group. Goddard and his team at Chuhai Labs keep up the banter between Bowie and his group throughout the stage. And when Boss--that is his name--shows up to fight them at the end of the level, even he gets in on the chatter. The final version of the game will feature multiple biomes for the team to fly over, and Bowie can already do a Fox McCloud-style barrel roll. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

The game expands the series' narrative scope with a new setting, new characters, and overhauled gameplay systems that make of one of the scariest games of the year. And while the game only recently launched back in late September, it's already on sale thanks to early Black Friday discounts at Amazon and Best Buy. You can pick up the Amazon-exclusive Silent Hill f Day One Edition for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X for $50 (originally $70), which includes with a double-sided poster featuring art from the game and some digital bonuses. Meanwhile, at Best Buy, you can pick up the Silent Hill f standard edition, which is also down to $50 (was $70). Silent Hill f Day One Edition (Amazon-Exclusive) $50 (was $70) The Day One Edition is exclusive to Amazon and includes a physical poster and a handful of extra in-game items. The cover art also features an emblem in the upper left denoting it's the Day One Edition. Here's what you'll get: Silent Hill f base game A double-sided poster featuring protagonist Shimizu Hanako White Sailor School Uniform Peony Umamori Item Pack: Shriveled Abura-age, Divine Water, and First-aid Kit Amazon's deal applies to the PS5 and Xbox Series X versions of the game. See at Amazon Silent Hill f Standard Edition $50 (was $70) The Silent Hill f standard edition doesn't include the bonuses from the Day One Edition, but you're at least getting the full game at a $20 discount thanks to Best Buy's deal, which applies to both the PS5 and Xbox Series X physical versions. Since it's the same price as the Day One Edition, we recommend going for the standard edition only if the Day One Edition sells out at Amazon. See at Best Buy Silent Hill f captures the challenging, claustrophobic gameplay and dreary, macabre settings the series is known for, but moves the horror from the U.S. to Japan for the first time. With a new story, setting, and combat mechanics, Silent Hill f is both a good place to start if you're new to the series, and a benchmark moving forward, according to GameSpot's review by Jessica Cogswell. If you're looking for more survival horror deals, you can also grab the Silent Hill 2 Remake on PS5 for $30 (was $50) at both Amazon and Best Buy. Silent Hill titles are known for their deep exploration of human trauma fear, and Silent Hill 2 is the series' most apt example of this. As part of our best games of 2024 list, it expertly recaptured the original version's harrowing story, but with higher fidelity visuals, new voice acting, overhauled and expanded gameplay, and modern quality-of-life features.

    "description": "Cronos: The New Dawn (PS5) $40 (was $60) See at Amazon Cronos: The New Dawn (Switch 2) $45 (was $60) See at Amazon This year has been a strong one for survival horror games, and one of the highlights has been Cronos: The New Dawn, an original horror game from Bloober Team, the studio behind last year's critically acclaimed Silent Hill 2 remake. The sci-fi horror adventure launched just a few weeks ago back in September, but thanks to Amazon's Black Friday sale, you can grab Cronos: The New Dawn for up to 30% off. The discount varies between platforms--the PS5 version is just $40 (was $60), while the Switch 2 edition is discounted to $45 (was $60). This is the biggest price cut we've seen for the physical edition, but it will only be available for a limited time. Cronos: The New Dawn (PS5) $40 (was $60) Set in a futuristic rendition of Eastern Europe that has been radically altered due to a mysterious event, players step into the boots of the Traveler. Using time travel, the Traveler journeys back to 1980s Poland on behalf of a group known as The Collective to rescue key people before they die in the coming cataclysm. The Traveler has an arsenal of weapons to keep mutants at bay, but failing to dispose of their remains properly will result in surviving enemies fusing with the corpses to create a tougher and more dangerous creature. See at Amazon Cronos: The New Dawn (Switch 2) $45 (was $60) The Switch 2 version of Cronos: The New Dawn runs at a mostly stable 30fps. Some graphical concessions have been made, but the overall tone and atmosphere have been retained. This is a Game Key card version of the game, and it requires 25GB of storage space on the Switch 2. See at Amazon \"While it doesn't achieve the incredible heights of the Silent Hill 2 remake, Cronos earns its own name in the genre with an intense sci-fi horror story that will do well to satisfy anyone's horror fix, provided they can stomach its sometimes brutal enemy encounters,\" Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's review, scoring the game 8/10.

    "title": "Get Sony's Belt Drive Turntable For Cheap During Black Friday",
    "description": "Sony PS-LX310BT Turntable $200 (was $450) See at Amazon See at Best Buy See at Sony Store Music streaming might be convenient, but it lacks the quality of physical media. You can find out for yourself just how good vinyl can sound in the modern era with this Black Friday deal on the Sony PS-LX310BT turntable, which is just $200 (normally $450) at Amazon, Best Buy, and the Sony store. This belt-driven turntable was introduced several years ago, and it blends classic audio technology with a few high-tech features, like Bluetooth connectivity. It's a great, user-friendly turntable choice, especially while it's nearly 60% off right now. Sony PS-LX310BT Turntable $200 (was $450) Designed to be a plug-and-play turntable, the PS-LX310BT is a user-friendly option for anyone looking to purchase their first device in this category. It has a fully automatic design and setting up the drive belt can easily be done in a few minutes. While the body is mostly plastic, the Sony turntable does have an aluminum die-cast platter and pipe tonearm. The included RCA cables let you plug it directly into a stereo system, but for wireless listening, you can connect Bluetooth-enabled devices like speakers and headphones. Other features include two speeds--33 1/3 rpm and 45 rpm--a built-in switchable phono/line-out phono preamp, three gain settings, a vibration-dampening slip mat, and a removable dust cover. See at Amazon See at Best Buy See at Sony Store Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones $248 (was $400) Since you can connect a wireless headset to the turntable, we'd recommend grabbing one of Sony's popular noise-canceling headphones to go with this. Normally $400, the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones are on sale for $248, and they come in four distinct colors. The big draw is the noise-canceling features, which use what Sony calls \"Auto NC Optimizer\" to automatically adjust the function based on your environment. The headphones also feature a lightweight design with soft leather, a battery life of up to 30 hours, and a selection of touch-control settings for media playback and communication. Black Midnight Blue Silver Smoky Pink See at Amazon We've also included several Bluetooth speakers below from Bose, Sony, and JBL that are on sale for Black Friday. While a stereo system is preferred for turntables, you can still get a high-quality audio experience from these devices, and their wireless nature helps reduce cable management. The other benefit is that this also makes it easier to transport your turntable to a function or a party, and there is a wide variety of speakers to choose from. JBL has pocket-friendly devices like the JBL Go, while Sony's range includes multi-function speakers with a similar design aesthetic to the turntable.
