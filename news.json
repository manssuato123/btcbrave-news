Released last year with a $90 retail price, the three-film 4K Blu-ray box set is on sale for only $39 at Amazon. This is a new all-time low for The Ring Collection, which you'll need if you want to watch The Ring 2 and Rings on 4K Blu-ray; neither sequel has received a standalone 4K release. If you only want the first (and best) film in the series, The Ring Limited Edition Steelbook is discounted to only $19 (was $35), which is the lowest price yet and actually slightly cheaper than the standard edition 4K Blu-ray ($20.29). And if you're interested in comparing the Hollywood version of The Ring to the original Japanese film, Arrow Video's 4K Blu-ray restoration of Ringu is available for $35 (was $50). Alternatively, the Ringu 4-Film Collection is discounted to $46.69, which is an all-time low for this Blu-ray box set. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

After kidnapping and trapping her in their basement, the trio engages in a battle of wits, interrogation, and torture, with the film becoming increasingly unpredictable as it races towards its conclusion. While it wasn't a box-office hit, Bugonia did earn relatively high praise from critics and audiences alike thanks to the standout performances of the cast and its wild plot twists.

    "description": "The third entry in Disney's cult-classic sci-fi franchise, Tron: Ares, premiered in theaters earlier this year. The film expands the franchise's mythos with a new story centered on the titular Ares (Jared Leto), a self-aware artificial being who manages to exit the virtual reality of Tron and enter the real world. If you missed it, or you're already a fan and want to add it to your collection, preorders are now live for the Tron: Ares Blu-ray, which releases on January 6, 2026. The film will launch in multiple formats, including a limited-edition steelbook version that you can preorder for $45 at Amazon. Standard edition 4K Blu-ray, regular Blu-ray, and DVD versions are also available. Tron: Ares Limited-Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray) $45 | Releases January 6, 2026 The steelbook edition features artwork of the film's primary cast on the front, and the stylish teaser poster for Tron: Ares on the rear. On the inside, you'll find a screenshot from the movie pulled from the action-packed lightcycle chase scene. The movie supports Dolby Atmos and HDR10, and it includes a selection of featurettes that examine the production of Tron: Ares. Director Joachim Rønning and star Jared Leto appear in several of these short documentaries to talk about their passion for the Tron franchise, and several deleted scenes are also included. See at Amazon See at Walmart Tron: Ares (4K Blu-ray) $50 - 30 | Releases January 6, 2026 The regular 4K edition features a cover based on the Tron: Ares poster that featured a gravity-defying lightcycle ride up a skyscraper. This version includes the same special features as the steelbook edition, along with the aforementioned standard Blu-ray and digital copies of the movie. Along with these 4K editions, the Tron: Ares standard Blu-ray and DVD versions are also available to preorder. See at Amazon See at Walmart Tron 3-Movie Collection (DVD) $35 | Releases January 6, 2026 All three Tron movies will also be released as a bundle, but the strange thing is that this collection is only on DVD. The DVD listing doesn't mention special features either, so it looks like this will likely be a film-only release.

The movie grossed only $142 million worldwide and received lukewarm critical reception at best. Audience reviews have been kinder, and while the film may not have reached the same heights as the original Tron or 2010's Tron: Legacy, there is still appreciation for how it pushes the franchise's concepts further and for its hard-hitting Nine Inch Nails soundtrack. Unlike the Tron movies, which were set on the digital frontier of the Grid, Tron: Ares explores the ramifications of that world crossing over into ours. Centered around Ares, a highly sophisticated Program, the movie chronicles the first meeting between humanity and digital AI beings. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Last week, Netflix put forth an $82 million deal to purchase Warner Bros. Studios, one of the biggest movie and TV studios in the world. Warner Bros. also has a considerable place in the video game industry with franchises like Batman, Harry Potter, and Mortal Kombat under its domain. However, one Netflix executive has now acknowledged that Warner Bros.' gaming division wasn't a significant factor in considering its bid. During a Netflix conference call about the potential WB sale, co-CEO Gregory K. Peters expressed some eagerness to exploit the video game franchises under Warner Bros. in the future. But he added that the games were \"relatively minor\" in the company's initial plans and that it may be \"worth going back again to sort of how we thought about the deal and building our valuation model.\" \"While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space, we actually didn’t attribute any value to that from the get-go because they're relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things,\" continued Peters. \"Now we are super excited because some of those properties that they've built--[Hogwarts Legacy] is a great example of that--have been done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we're offering. They've got great studios and great folks working there. So we think that there's definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven't built that into our deal model.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",
