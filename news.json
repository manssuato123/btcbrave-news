The Bloomberg report said that beginning in late October, Naughty Dog asked staff to work \"a minimum of eight extra hours a week\" and document their overtime in a spreadsheet. \"This overtime period was an attempt to get the production back on track after several missed deadlines,\" the report said. Workers were told to not work more than 60 hours per week, the report said. The return-to-office mandate was disruptive to some workers who reportedly had to find cover for childcare and their pets. The report added that the \"mandated overtime\" period wrapped up this week with the completion of the demo. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Let's take a look at what we've got here. Table of Contents [hide] Winterfest 2025 quests Drop 1Collect a Perfect Gift from a chest Winterfest 2025 quests The first of these new quests sets, listed under Winterfest in your quest log, are for Battle Royale. There are four time-gated groups of this set of quests--the first group is available now, and the rest will be added every two days until they're all there. Completing a quest awards 12K XP each, and there may be a reward at the end of the questline--but we don't know for sure yet. These quests expire when Winterfest ends on January 5. Drop 1 Collect a Perfect Gift from a chest Every chest you open during Winterfest has a change to drop an item called Perfect Gift, which triggers a quest to deliver it to any non-hostile NPC on the map within five minutes. But for this quest, you just have to collect the item. Fortunately, the Perfect Gift does not require one of your inventory slots. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "Arc Raiders Dev Looks Back On Game's Huge Launch, Says \"The Work Is Just Beginning\"",
    "description": "It's impossible to deny the success of Embark Studios' extraction shooter Arc Raiders. Now, as 2025 comes to a close, the studio is reflecting on the momentous launch, which was recently capped off by the title's win for Best Multiplayer Game at the 2025 Game Awards, and what's to come in 2026. If you're to believe Embark, which seems on top of the world right now, \"the work is just beginning.\" In a post to Arc Raiders website, the shooter's executive producer Aleksander Grondal writes, \"We had a feeling that Arc Raiders was something special. Internally, we were having a blast playing it before release, and your reaction to the tech test in April gave us an inkling of what was to come. What we didn't count on was the sheer scale of love and passion you guys were going to show this game.\" Arc Raiders, which was released in late October, became a smash hit right out of the gate, selling millions of copies within days and solidifying itself as one of the most-beloved multiplayer games of the year. Though many multiplayer games enjoy a surge of popularity that eventually relents, Arc Raiders has held on impressively long. As of this writing, its Steam numbers alone are still in the six-digit realm. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Dispatch feels like the kind of game that must have always been headed for success, having sold a million copies in just 10 days, and while it missed most of the awards season, it still landed on several best-of lists for the year. That impression hides a much rougher reality. Dispatch took years longer than expected, nearly collapsed more than once, and only made it out because the team managed to survive long enough to finish it. \"We're taking GTA 6 amounts of time on this shit,\" writer and co-founder Pierre Shorette says in an interview with Eurogamer, explaining why Dispatch Season 1 took so long to make. The episodic superhero workplace comedy spent close to seven years in development. The time spent wasn't about endlessly refining a hit, but about dealing with lost funding, shifting plans, and simple survival. The upside is that the groundwork is now done, meaning a potential Season 2 would not need anything close to the same amount of time. Game director Nick Herman is blunt about how close Dispatch came to ending. \"We had a publisher who dropped us halfway through because of … financial things,\" he says. Shorette places that moment in the context of the wider industry collapse. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

(@LarAtLarian) December 18, 2025 Vincke continues, \"Larian's DNA is agency. Everything we work towards is to the benefit of our teams, games, players. A better work day, and a better game. Our successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possible make.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "There have been some mismatched crossovers before, but Sonic Rumble may be taking that to a new level as the King of the Monsters himself, Godzilla, invades Sonic the Hedgehog's new mobile game. On December 22, Sega and Rovio will unleash Toho's iconic monster on Dr. Eggman's Toy World with a new stage: Godzilla Survival. The goal of that stage is simple. Players simply have to survive a Godzilla attack in the middle of the ocean while running from boat to boat. Trust us, you don't want to be stuck when Godzilla unleashes his atomic fire. Players will only get a single respawn on this stage, so run as if your virtual life depends upon it. Because it does. Sonic Rumble's free pass will unlock Godzilla and his fellow monster, Fire Rodan, without charging players. However, the premium pass will unlock Mothra and King Ghidorah, and it gives Godzilla his nuclear pulse ability in addition to his heat ray. The RSR Shop will also allow players to purchase Mecha Godzilla and his Absolute Zero blast as well as Destroyah and his Variable Slicer ability. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
