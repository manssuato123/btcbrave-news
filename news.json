    "description": "Ray-Ban X Meta Smart Glasses - Wayfarer Frames (Gen 1) Starts at $239 See at Amazon If you've ever wished your sunglasses could play music, take photos, or even answer questions for you, then you're in luck. Select Ray-Ban Meta AI Glasses models are seeing generous discounts for Black Friday 2025. These are all Gen 1 models--so they won't have the extended battery life or upgraded cameras of the Gen 2 models--but they still offer many of the same features as the newer models, including Meta AI support, built-in speakers and camera, and more. While the smart glasses are available in a variety of frames and lens styles, it looks like only the Wayfarer frames are currently getting discounts. You can snag a pair for as low as $239.20 (normally $299) thanks to Amazon's sale. Ray-Ban X Meta Smart Glasses - Wayfarer Frames (Gen 1) Starts at $239 If you're unfamiliar with Meta's collaboration with Ray-Ban, these smart glasses aren't your average pair of frames. Inside its larger arms, you'll find heaps of cool tech that lets you ask Meta AI questions, take photos or videos, or listen to music. You can even ask Meta AI what you're looking at, making the smart glasses a helpful travel companion. The frames are only slightly thicker than those of some typical glasses, so unless someone is looking closely, most won't even realize you have a computer sitting on your head. As for the actual specs, you'll find an ultra-wide 12MP camera, a five-mic system for easy voice recognition, an included charging and travel case, and a built-in button to activate its AI. Any images or footage you capture can also be easily shared on Facebook or Instagram. See at Amazon While these AI-powered smart glasses are stylish, they're much simpler compared to AR and VR devices. Those who are interested in something more powerful should also check out Amazon's limited-time Black Friday deals on the Meta Quest 3S VR headset. Amazon has two deals available--the first drops the Mea Quest 3S 128GB model to just $250 (was $300) and includes a $50 Amazon gift card as a free bonus.

    "description": "Lego Super Mario: Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle (738 Pieces) $28 (was $65) | Retiring soon See at Amazon For the second week in a row, Amazon is selling a Lego Super Mario playset for over 50% off during its Black Friday sale. Last week it was Soda Jungle Maker, and this week it's Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle. Normally $65, this 738-piece building set is discounted to only $28. Like Soda Jungle Maker, Peach's Castle is retiring soon, so this is likely your last chance to get a massive discount on the set. Amazon has already sold out of this deal once today (November 23), but the deal is back in stock as of 5:55 PM PT. Lego Super Mario: Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle (738 Pieces) $28 (was $65) | Retiring soon Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle comes with three buildable Lego Super Mario figures: Roy, Red Toad, and a Chain Chomp that pulls Roy's sled. It doesn't include Peach, who is only available as an interactive figure in the Super Mario Adventures Starter Set, which is on sale for $40 (was $50). The castle's fold-out walls are destructible, so you can easily refortify your defenses after Chain Chomp crashes into them. Toad can sling projectiles at Roy and Chain Chomp with a built-in catapult atop the castle. If you have Interactive Princess Peach, you can tap the Action Tags on the rotating throne, in the small garden where Toad likes to hang out, and in hidden spots. Tapping an Action Tag plays music and sound effects from the Peach figure's built-in speakers.

The Lenovo Legion Go S has been heavily discounted, with prices ranging from $450 (was $650) for the Z2 model with a 512GB SSD and the version with the Z1 Extreme chipset, more RAM, and a 1TB SSD is available for $650 (was $900). These powerful portable gaming devices let you play the latest PC games on the go, making them an excellent gift for the hardcore PC gamer in your life. Just make sure you grab these deals soon, as these Best Buy discounts won't last long. Legion Go S (Z2, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) $450 (was $650) The Lenovo Legion Go S comes equipped with an 8-inch 120Hz Lenovo PureSight 1200p display and an AMD Ryzen Z2 Go chip with Radeon graphics. This model includes a 512GB SSD, 16GB of RAM, and it runs on Valve's operating system, SteamOS. Storage can be expanded through the microSD slot if 512GB feels too limiting. Games typically run well from a microSD card on SteamOS, and the Z2 chip paired with Radeon graphics can handle a wide range of titles. The handheld measures 11.75 x 1.71 x 5.02 inches, and it has a 3.5mm audio jack, two USB-C ports, offset thumbsticks, two remappable back triggers, and a small trackpad. See at Best Buy Legion Go S (Z1 Extreme, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) $650 (was $900) The higher-end configuration of the Lenovo Legion Go S uses the older but still powerful AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip with AMD RDNA 3 graphics. It has 32GB of RAM and a larger 1TB SSD, and like the model above, it runs on SteamOS. It features the same screen, inputs, and ergonomic design that has earned praise from critics. See at Best Buy Other handheld gaming PCs, such as the recently released ROG Xbox Ally X, are still selling at their regular MSRP, but Best Buy is offering discounts on the MSI Claw. You can save $180 to $265 on two models: the MSI Claw A1M with a 512GB SSD is down to $390, down from $650, while the 1TB version is $565 (was $750). These units feature 7-inch 1080p screens with a 120Hz refresh rate; 16GB of RAM, Intel Arc Graphics 8X cores, and Intel Core Ultra processors. MSI Claw A1MBoth MSI Claw models run Windows 11, which means you can load games from multiple storefronts, including Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store. The trade-off is that Windows can be cumbersome on a handheld PC, but if that does not bother you, you will have far more flexibility when installing and managing games.

    "title": "Sonic X Shadow Generations for Switch 2 is 50% off (BF2025)",

The game features a remaster of 2011's Sonic Generations alongside the all-new Shadow Generations, offering fans two completely unique games in one package. And now, for Black Friday 2025, the game is discounted to its lowest price ever of just $25 (was $50) on Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X. You'll also find a bunch of other Sonic games on sale during the event, making this a good time to stock up on titles you may have missed over the past few years. Sonic X Shadow Generations $25 (was $50) Sonic X Shadow Generations offers both 3D and 2D adventures, playing as a greatest-hits roundup for the Blue Blur. For a change of pace, however, you can dive into Shadow Generations, which lets you take control of Shadow as he fights through a brand new adventure. There are plenty of Easter eggs and additional content packed into the bundle--so even once you beat the game, there's always a reason to come back for more. This includes hidden Chao across each level, a chance to play pinball in the Casino Nights zone, and a museum featuring all sorts of behind-the-scenes material. Sonic X Shadow Generations Deals At Amazon PS5 -- $25 ($50) Xbox -- $25 ($50) Switch -- $25 ($50) Switch 2 -- $25 ($50) See all at Amazon Our Sonic X Shadow Generations review called it a \"nice enough trip down memory lane,\" though it does come with some friction due to the age of Sonic Generations. If you're a Sonic fan, you'll probably find something here of value (especially at $25). \"Shadow Generations' story is a great opportunity to revisit some of Shadow's most memorable moments as well as past boss battles against other artificial beings that could be considered rivals to the title of \"ultimate life form,\" like the Biolizard from Sonic Adventure 2,\" wrote critic Jordan Ramée. \"I was grinning like a kid again when Shadow faced off against Metal Overlord and Crush 40's \"What I'm Made Of...\" started playing, reminding me of the hours I lost to Sonic Heroes when I was 10 years old.\" Many other Sonic games are on sale for Black Friday, including Sonic Frontiers, which is down to $18 on PS5, $16 on PS4, $10 on Xbox Series X, and $25 on Switch. You can also pick up the Sonic Mania + Team Sonic Racing Double Pack for just $20 (was $40). You'll find a list of even more Sonic game deals below. While these are big discounts on some of the Blue Hedgehog's latest games, keep in mind these deals will likely vanish after Black Friday, so be sure to take advantage of them while they're still active.

    "description": "Atlus RPG Black Friday deals Save up to 70% See at Amazon If you're craving a big RPG for the winter months, you're in luck. Several of Atlus and Sega's best RPGs are up to 70% off at Amazon thanks to Black Friday. The deals include Metaphor ReFantazio--the recipient of GameSpot's 2024 Game of the Year pick--which is on sale for for $35 (was $70) for both PS5 and Xbox Series X. While Metaphor ReFantazio's sweeping fantasy story could easily keep you busy for 80 to 100 hours, there are also plenty of other epic RPGs on sale right now, including Persona 3: Reload, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance Edition, Raidou Remastered, and more. We've rounded up all the Atlus RPG Black Friday deals below--be sure to grab them while you can, because these limited-time discounts could sell out fast. After you've checked those out, head over to GameSpot's Black Friday Deals Hub to see all the best holiday price cuts on video games, PC hardware, collectible figures, and more. Metaphor ReFantazio $35 (was $70) Metaphor ReFantazio shares several elements with other JRPGS from Atlus, but it also streamlines the experience and keeps players invested with enticing gameplay and a roster of lovable characters. While it's an engaging game to play, Metaphor ReFantazio shines brightest when its narrative steps into the spotlight, as the game features a story honed to a razor's edge by Atlus subsidiary Studio Zero. It's a story about stories, cleverly woven into the fabric of the game and bolstered by rich lore, in-depth worldbuilding, and an art direction that makes the fantasy of Metaphor ReFantazio look unique. The game received a rare 10/10 in GameSpot's review and it was also named our 2024 Game of the Year. Metaphor ReFantazio deals at Amazon PS5 -- $35 ($70) Xbox Series X -- $35 ($70) See at Amazon Persona 3: Reload Starts at $18 A remake of 2006's Persona 3, Persona 3 Reload keeps the game's core story intact and elevates it with brand-new gameplay and visuals. Still faithful to the original, Persona 3 Reload makes an already great game even better with its enhancements. Amazon's pricing differs between consoles--PS5 owners can get the game for just $18, while the PS4 version is $20, the Xbox Series X version is $25, and the Switch 2 version is $40 (was $60). Note that the Switch 2 version is a game key-card release, meaning you have to download the digital version to your console (around 25.3GB file size) before you can play. Persona 3: Reload deals at Amazon PS5 -- $18 ($70) PS4 -- $20 ($70) Xbox Series X -- $25 ($70) Switch 2 (Game Key-Card) -- $40 ($60) See at Amazon Persona 5 Royal (Switch) $25 (was $60) Atlus had earned a loyal following over the years with its Persona games, but Persona 5 is arguably the game that put the company on radar of JRPG fans looking for something different. The anime art style, rich character relationships, and an overarching story that will take dozens of hours to complete made it a big hit, and the Royal Edition of the game fleshes out those aspects of the game even further with quality-of-life tweaks and more content. See at Amazon Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army $30 (was $50) Another blast from the past, Raidou Remastered is a remake of a 2006 PS2 game from the Shin Megami Tensei series. Part of the Devil Summoner subseries, the action-RPG features revamped visuals and audio, combat enhancements, brand voice acting, expanded 3D environments, and a slick user interface. Set in 1930s Tokyo, players embark on a supernatural adventure, collecting dozens of demons to aid them in their quest to prevent humanity from being consumed by darkness. As with other Atlus games released on Switch 2, Raidou Remastered's physical Switch 2 edition is a game key-card that grants access to the digital version of the game, rather than storing the game data on the cart.

    "title": "Monster Hunter Stories Collection For Nintendo Switch Gets $35 Discount For Black Friday",
    "description": "Monster Hunter Stories Collection (Switch) $25 (was $60) See at Amazon If you want to revisit the first two Monster Hunter Stories games before Twisted Reflection launches next March, Amazon has an incredible Black Friday deal on the two-game bundle for Nintendo Switch. Monster Hunter Stories Collection is up for grabs for only $25, which is a new all-time low for the bundle since its launch launch last June. If you'd rather play on PC or Steam Deck, you can get the Steam version of Monster Hunter Stories Collection for only $16.79 at GameSpot's sister site Fanatical. The collection includes the 2024 enhanced edition of the first Monster Hunter Stories as well as the 2021 sequel Wings of Ruin. Fanatical also has preorder deals for Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection. Monster Hunter Stories Collection (Switch) $25 (was $60) If you like Pokemon games, Capcom's spin on monster-taming games is definitely worth checking out. This pair of turn-based RPGs are radically different from the mainline Monster Hunter franchise, but you'll still get to spend time with some of the franchise's best-known monsters. And you're getting a lot of game for your money here. Both Monster Hunter Stories games are 30-40 hours, on the low end, and the plethora of optional content can double those figures. Monster Hunter Stories originally released in North America as a Nintendo 3DS exclusive in 2017. It received an HD mobile port the following year. The enhanced edition for modern consoles and PC has overhauled visuals, full English and Japanese voiceovers, and content from the 3DS version that didn't make it into the mobile port. Alongside the games, Capcom added a Museum Mode filled with artwork and music. Switch and Switch 2 owners should know that only Monster Hunter Stories is included on the cartridge; Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin is a digital download from the eShop and requires roughly 14GB of storage space. The sequel received a physical edition back when it first launched in 2021, so you can technically still get both Monster Hunter Stories games in true physical format, but it'll typically cost you more than the collection since Wings of Ruin is out of print. See at Amazon Another Monster Hunter game for Nintendo Switch that's definitely worth checking out is Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate. Exclusive to Switch, Generations Ultimate is essentially a greatest hits compilation of the pre-Monster Hunter World era. It's an absolutely massive game that can take upward of 80-100 hours just to complete the mainline missions. It offers hundreds of hours of content overall. You can get a physical edition of Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate for $32 at Amazon. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
