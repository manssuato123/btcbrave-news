    "description": "If you've been looking for more of a challenge from Dying Light: The Beast, then you're about to get it. Developer Techland has dropped Update 1.5 for Dying Light: The Beast, and it's giving players the chance to test their skills in the Nightmare Experience. To turn up the heat on players, human and infected enemies are now smarter, more aggressive, significantly stronger, and more reactive to the players' actions. Volatiles may now even appear during the day in some of the Dark Zones, and players have far fewer resources to deal with them all. If that wasn't enough, there's a new super enemy, the Alpha Volatile. Techland calls it \"the most intelligent Volatile in the history of Dying Light.\" It's even smarter than the traditional Volatiles and its heightened senses can track the player across the entire map unless they reach a safe zone. The Alpha Volatiles can be killed, but good luck trying to pull that off. At night, the player is the prey for this creature. Players can also get new finishing maneuvers, including one-handed blunt weapons and one-handed slashing weapons. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Preorders for the It: Welcome to Derry Limited Edition Steelbook initially sold out in hours, but it's back in stock at Amazon for $45 and Walmart for $57. If you're a Stephen King fan, it'd probably be wise to preorder ASAP. Steelbook Editions of the two-part It film adaptation sold out fast, and Welcome to Derry is the first TV series based on a Stephen King novel to get a 4K Blu-ray edition. At this time, the Limited Edition Steelbook is the only way to get the series on 4K Blu-ray. Welcome to Derry: Season 1 is available to stream in full on HBO Max. Alternatively, you can buy Season 1 on other streaming platforms like Amazon Prime Video for $22. Welcome to Derry holds an 80% on Rotten Tomatoes, and I think many longtime fans of King's legendary horror novel would say Season 1 was pretty great. HBO has yet to renew the series for a second season, but director Andy Muschietti has a three-season arc in mind. Season 1 tells the story of Pennywise's reign of terror in 1962. Season 2 would rewind the clock 27 years to Pennywise's previous feeding cycle in 1935, and Season 3 would be set in 1908. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Sosuy Motorized Coin Pusher Arcade Game Building Set (2,093 pieces) $61.74 (was $80) See at Amazon If you're looking for a last-minute Christmas gift, check out the Motorized Coin Pusher Arcade Game Building Set on sale at Amazon. Available for $61.74 (was $80), it lets you build a functional replica of the fun coin pushing games found at the arcade. This is the first real discount we've seen for the product, and it looks like a neat project to work on over the holidays. Sosuy Motorized Coin Pusher Arcade Game Building Set (2,093 pieces) $61.74 (was $80) While kids will have fun playing with the Coin Pusher Arcade Game once the build is complete, they'll probably need an adult to help snap together its 2,093 pieces. Not only are there a lot of pieces, but the kit features a bunch of moving parts that likely require a skilled hand to get working properly. For example, the finished game features a movable coin slot, a rotatable switch, and an electric motor drive. In other words, parents can have fun constructing the complex machine alongside their kids, making it a cool winter activity for the whole family. Once the building is done, the machine comes with everything you need to start playing like you're at the arcade, including dozens of durable plastic coins. See at Amazon The completed machine stands nearly 17 inches tall and 11 inches wide, making it a pretty robust project. It looks quite premium, too, with a retro yellow-and-red design and a little \"Coin\" marquee at the top by the coin slot. While the brand, Sosuy, doesn't have the name recognition of Lego, it's responsible for some unique building kits. Beyond this game, it sells a Bumper Cars Building Set featuring movable vehicles. It's also on sale ahead of the holidays, now just $48.44 (was $60) at Amazon. And though it's not discounted, the Water Slide Building Set offers a colorful design, a slidable track, a functioning chain to move its passengers, and spans nearly two feet when completed.

This 4K Blu-ray bundle launched for $100 last year, but it's now discounted to its lowest price yet at $49.49 on Amazon. It also comes with digital copies of all five movies. This is an awesome deal on one of the most acclaimed action film series, but the price cut ends until 11:59 PM PT, so you only have a few more hours to take advantage of the deal. Mad Max 5-Film Collection (4K Blu-ray) $49.49 (was $80) Set in a dystopian future where society has broken down in the wake of resource and water wars, the box set includes Mad Max, Mad Max: The Road Warrior, Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, Mad Max: Fury Road, and Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga. The slipcase also pays tribute to the film series, featuring artwork showcasing various images of the bandits and the vehicles that hunted down Max and Furiosa throughout each movie. This collection includes a curated selection of special features pulled from previous Blu-ray releases. You can sit down for several behind-the-scenes documentaries, deleted scenes, and featurettes that explore the chaotic world of the film series. What makes this edition special is that it is the only 4K Blu-ray box set to include the physical Black &amp; Chrome editions of Fury Road and Furiosa. Both movies look stunning in black and white, as each film was re-graded to create striking images bereft of color. The only downside to this collection is that there are no special features included for Beyond Thunderdome. Mad Max fans will be used to this, since no bonus materials were included on the original DVD or on standard Blu-ray copies of the film.
