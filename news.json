The app also features mobile versions of Fortnite, Fall Guys, and Rocket League Sideswipe. To access these games you will need to create a free Epic account and install the free Epic Games Store mobile app and log in with your account, but once you do, you can start claiming your free games every Thursday through it. One other thing to note is that Android users can access the app via Android-based emulation devices like Retroid Pocket, as they aren't limited to just smartphone and tablets. Download the Epic Games Store Mobile app For now, only iOS users in the European Union can install the app, but the app is available worldwide to Android device users and they have a wider selection of games to choose from in comparison. Like its PC counterpart, you'll have one week to grab each game that's offered. Here's a closer look at what you can grab this week, and what the current mobile games library has to offer.

Borderlands 4 is on sale for only $35 just two months after its release. The 50% discount is for the physical edition on PS5 and Xbox Series X. This deal first popped up today (November 27) at GameStop, and Amazon matched it shortly after. Amazon has sold out of the PS5 edition once already, so this deal might not be available after today. Borderlands 4 for PS5 / Xbox Series X $35 (was $70) While previous Borderlands games were primarily set on the planet of Pandora--Borderlands 3 expanded on this with several more planets to visit--Borderlands 4 takes place on the world of Kairos, giving players free rein to cause some chaos as they take on the forces of the Timekeeper. Just like its predecessors, the key goal here is to take control of one of four unique Vault Hunters, grow their skills, and strengthen them further by finding powerful weapons and gear. It's a formula that has been present since the original Borderlands game, but in Borderlands 4, that gameplay has been fine-tuned to its best and enhanced with quality-of-life features. PS5 -- $35 ($70) Xbox Series X -- $35 ($70) See at Amazon See at GameStop Borderlands 4 for Nintendo Switch 2 $55 (was $70) | Release Date TBA The Nintendo Switch 2 port of Borderlands 4 was originally slated for October 3, just a few weeks after the game's September 1 launch on other platforms. But then about a week before launch day, Gearbox announced an indefinite delay to polish the experience on Switch 2. If you're planning on buying Borderlands 4 for Nintendo Switch 2, it makes sense to secure a preorder right now. Target has slashed $15 from the price. Amazon was matching this offer but sold out fast. Keep in mind this is a Game-Key Card, so you will need to download Borderlands 4 from the eShop after loading the cartridge into your console for the first time.
