    "description": "Lego Star Wars Imperial Star Destroyer (1,555 pieces) $120 (was $160) See at Amazon Amazon has added one of the most popular Lego Star Wars ships available today to its Black Friday Lego sale. The 1,555-piece Imperial Star Destroyer is on sale for $120 (was $160) while supplies last. This Star Destroyer launched last August as part of the Lego Star Wars 25th Anniversary collection. It comes with seven minifigures, including a 25th Anniversary minifigure of Cal Kestis from Respawn's Star Wars Jedi series. The Imperial Star Destroyer is based on the ship from the opening chase scene of Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope. Once fully constructed, the Star Destroyer measures 18 x 11.5 x 6 inches. It's rather fitting that Amazon added the Star Destroye to its Black Friday sale, because Star Wars fans can also get the Lego version of the ship Darth Vader and his crew were chasing: Princess Leia's Tantive IV. The 654-piece Tantive IV display model is 50% off at Amazon and Walmart. You could pair both of these ships with Lego's Boarding the Tantive IV diorama, which is on sale for $38.49 (was $55) and depicts what happens after the Star Destroyer catches the Tantive IV. It's also worth noting Lego's 630-piece midi-scale model of Darth Vader's Executor Super Star Destroyer from Return of the Jedi is on sale for $40 (was $70) at Walmart. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Woot! Black Friday Video Game Mega Sale Save on video games &amp; hardware through December 2 See All Deals At Woot Amazon is a great spot to find Black Friday deals, but don't miss out on the discounts at Woot. Though it's not as popular, Woot is an Amazon company--meaning you can easily sign in with your Amazon account--and right now it's running the aptly named Video Game Mega Sale. Dozens of games and accessories are on sale until December 2, and we've listed some of our favorites below. However, Woot is offering a Black Friday-exclusive bonus offer for an additional 20% (up to a maximum $40 discount) when purchasing these items through the Woot app on your smartphone until Black Friday ends. You'll see the final discounted price at the very end of the checkout process (no promo code required), so consider downloading the app to save a few extra bucks. Check out our picks for the best Switch, Switch 2, PS5, and gaming accessory deals in Woot's sake below. And don't forget to hit up GameSpot's Black Friday Deals Hub for more of the best discounts available this weekend. Switch 1 &amp; 2 Game Deals Mario Kart World, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Pokemon Legends: ArceusOnly a few Switch 2 games are discounted at Woot, including Mario Kart World, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Switch 2 Edition, and Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV.
