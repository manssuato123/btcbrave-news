It's Fortnite's biggest party, typically drawing its biggest concurrent player numbers by a wide margin each year. In 2023 it drew more than 11 million players, and 2024's event pulled more than 14 million.

The Fortnite Chapter 6 finale event looks like it'll be quite a spectacle.When is Fortnite's Chapter 6 finale event going down?

    "description": "Developer Roblox Corporation recently introduced a new face-scanning feature as a way to increase child safety protection on its game creation platform, Roblox. CEO David Baszucki is very excited about this initiative, giving some rather intense and questionable answers during a new podcast episode about the age-gating technology. Baszucki sat down with The New York Times journalists Casey Newton and Kevin Roose for an episode of their Hard Fork podcast. Posted on November 21, the three engaged in a wide-ranging conversation that started with the face-scanning feature, moved to misnomers about data, and peaked at disgreements regarding the use of AI for moderation. Newtown opened with an inquiry about the problem with predators on Roblox, which Baszucki said is a good and bad dilemma. \"We think of it not necessarily just as a problem, but an opportunity as well,\" he said. \"How do we allow young people to build, communicate and hang out together? How do we build the future of communication at the same time? So we, you know, we’ve been, I think in a good way, working on this ever since we started. And when we were--this was almost 18 or 19 years ago--when we first launched the company and we had just four of us sitting in a room, we were literally the moderators, like we would rotate all the time.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's new version of Nuketown arrived on November 20, and one of the first things people tried on it was shooting off all the mannequin heads to unlock the long-running Nuketown Easter egg. Unfortunately, it doesn't work in Black Ops 7, at least not yet. This isn't a huge shock, though, as Black Ops 6's version of Nuketown didn't unlock the Easter egg right away, either. A popular video from the Detonated account shows that the mannequin heads on Nuketown 2025 cannot be shot off, thereby not allowing the Easter egg to unlock once they're all blasted away. People are theorizing that the new version of Nuketown does indeed carry forward the Easter egg that's been in every version of Nuketown since 2010, but it's just not active yet. You CANNOT Shoot the 'Mannequin Heads' on Nuketown 2025 in #BlackOps7 🤔The Map is also not available in Private Matches currently. pic.twitter.com/0oSVoltFVj — DETONATED (@DETONATEDcom) November 20, 2025 In Black Ops 6, zombified mannequins sprung forth from the ground for the Easter egg. And as ScreenRant reminds us, when Black Ops 6's version of Nuketown launched, it also didn't have the Easter egg unlocked, but it arrived around a week later. If the same pattern holds for Black Ops 7, fans can expect the latest version of the Easter egg to be here soon. Season 1 is expected to launch in early December, and this could be when the Easter egg gets unlocked for Black Ops 7, but that's just a guess. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

This includes a buff for guns in the submachine class, a nerf for the powerful Drone Pod field upgrade, and adjustments to Black Ops 7's controversial aim-assist. There's been plenty of community debate around Black Ops 7's aim-assist, which features greatly reduced rotational aim-assist compared to recent Call of Duty games. Black Ops 7 launched with a new right-stick aiming requirement for achieving maximum rotational aim-assist strength, meaning that when the right-stick isn't used or isn't tracking a target effectively, players experience minimal rotational aim-assist strength. This minimum aim-assist is a 35% reduction from what players experienced in the beta. In the patch notes, Treyarch says the studio \"slightly overshot\" its target balance, and a small tuning change is made to reduce this aim-assist penalty from 35% to 25%.

These are just the base versions of the four weapon types, but you'll be using whichever weapon you pick for several runs before you can unlock another one, making this choice one you'll want to think about. In this guide, we'll break down which weapon is best in Moonlighter 2, so you aren't stuck with the wrong one for a good while. Merchant's Sword The sword is considered a balanced weapon, offering a four-hit attack-pattern for its primary attack, with the final hit functioning as a finisher. The special move is a spinning attack, dealing damage in a circle around Will. If you use your special after three attacks, it transforms into a more powerful finisher. Merchant's Large Sword The Large Sword has a slow attack pattern, but it also has the strongest attacks. The primary attack has a three-hit pattern and uses sharpness on every attack. Your special is a quick jab attack that is much weaker but restores sharpness. The Sharpness meter is broken up by chunks, and for each missing chunk, you deal less damage.
