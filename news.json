    "description": "Epic Games has come up with an entirely new way to promote Fortnite's Chapter 6 finale event and launch of Chapter 7 this weekend: by briefly turning the storm circle into a \"storm seven\" for an hour on Tuesday morning. Look at this: Fortnite Battle Royale's storm circle took on a new shape for a bit.The change occurred at 6 AM PT and was reverted at 7 AM, with all games that started during that one-hour window having this odd new storm circle. The change was a promotional stunt to build hype for the Chapter 7 launch on Saturday, November 29--the chapter finale live event, which will only play one time ever, is Fortnite's biggest event every year, as it usually draws player counts in the tens of millions for whatever spectacle Epic has in store. But the emphasis on the number 7 isn't just because we're about to start Chapter 7. During the finale live event we're also expecting the return of the Seven--Fortnite's Avengers-esque team of superheroes that had been led by Dwayne \"The Foundation\" Johnson until the end of Chapter 3, when they were eaten by evil liquid chrome. No members of the Seven have been seen since the start of Chapter 4, and the game pretty much stopped referencing them completely in Chapter 5, so their return would be a big deal.

    "description": "One of this year's biggest gaming stories is the $55 billion sale of Electronic Arts to a group of private investors including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. Subsequently, there have been rumors that Saudi Arabia is backing Paramount's bid for Warner Brothers, which Paramount has denied. Now, a new report suggests that the PIF won't be making any new major purchases any time soon after experiencing a cash-flow problem. According to The New York Times, the PIF has been hit by a number of investments that are underwater financially. The report specifically mentioned that the planned Saudi Arabian city Neom and a ski resort with robot workers are among the PIF assets that are currently flailing. Saudi Arabia's wealth still stems from its vast oil deposits, but the kingdom has limitations on how much oil it can sell without violating agreements and treaties already in place. That could potentially mean PIF has been spending resources faster than Saudi Arabia can replenish the fund. PIF spokesperson Marwan Bakrali denied the report and told the New York Times that the PIF still has $60 billion in cash and \"similar financial instruments.\" Technically, the sale of EA has yet to officially go through yet, and it still needs regulatory approval in the US and other countries before it can be finalized.

    "description": "Marvel Snap will pay homage to classic comic team-ups with its next limited-time mode, Team Clash. The mode will reimagine dozens of existing cards as \"Team Clash\" versions with team-based synergies, and each team will have a passive ability to boost their strengths. The event will begin in late December. The six teams run the gamut of Marvel characters and classic team-ups: Avengers, X-Men, Brotherhood of Mutants, Thunderbolts, Guardians of the Galaxy, and the Spider-Verse. You'll be able to try out a pre-built deck with any of the six teams, or build your own custom Team Clash deck to try your own strategies. Your custom decks just need to have the six core cards for that team. Some cards have been subtly tweaked for the Team Clash mode, while others are completely different. For example, in the Avengers team, each time you play an Avenger, you give the others at that location +1 power. Team Clash Captain America has an ongoing ability similar to his regular one: Other Avengers at his location get +2 power. But Hulk has a bigger shift--a slight reduction in power, but an On Reveal that gains +2 power for each other Avenger at his location. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "title": "This Indie Game Has Been Banned On Steam Before It's Even Released",
    "description": "Earlier this year, Valve changed its rules to prevent adult games from having early-access releases on Steam. That came in the aftermath of a broader push against adult titles on Steam and Itch.io, largely at the behest of banks and payment processors. The upcoming indie horror game Horses is rated M for Mature, but it's not an adult title. Regardless, Steam informed the developer, Santa Ragione, that Horses was banned from the platform in 2023. The developer claims Valve has never explained its reasons for the ban in the two years since the ruling. Horses is a first-person title that casts players as a ranch hand who spends two weeks at an increasingly bizarre and unsettling farm. The horses in this game aren't horses at all. They're naked humans wearing horse masks who are forced to act like beasts of burden. Santa Ragione insists that Horses is not pornographic, and the publisher jokingly added that it apologizes if it \"got your hopes up for horse porn.\" Instead, Santa Ragione says it's using \"challenging, unconventional material to encourage discussion. It invites players to examine why something feels the way it does, what it says about the characters and systems at work, and where their limits lie. It is about tension, not erotic content.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

In a brief conversation with Channel 4's Sunday Brunch on November 23, the English producer and writer was asked if what led to GTA's mega-success had anything to do with the fact that the game is this sort of simulation for the version of ourselves that we can't actually live out. \"I think partly,\" Houser said. \"I think it's partly that, partly it put you in this exaggerated cinematic world, and mostly I would argue because it was this sense of freedom. Before that, games were either a shooting game or a driving game or a simulation game, and [GTA] was all three smashed together in a way that felt very free. And just, also, you know, when people talk about the metaverse or this digital world, those were the first games that showed you this idea of living in this fake place.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

That's the descriptor for titles to not only run well themselves, but to make sure the handheld is running efficiently as well--without owners having to tinker with settings. On Xbox Wire, the highlighted example for how default game profiles will work with ROG Xbox Ally handhelds is demonstrated with Hollow Knight: Silksong. By enacting the setting after the update, the metroidvania game should gain \"nearly an hour of battery life compared to performance mode while still delivering smooth 120fps gameplay.\" Default game profiles are starting in preview with 40 titles available, including Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, Doom: The Dark Ages, and Halo: The Master Chief Collection. Other improvements as part of the Xbox-branded handheld update are faster loading for your games library and \"improved gamepad response after login.\" In addition, Microsoft and Asus have teased future tweaks for the devices. They want to enhance \"sleep and wake reliability\" as well as add AI-powered automatic super resolution, for instance. Additionally, next week the plan is to introduce a game-save-sync indicator so you know when your progress is properly stored in the cloud to use on another system. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
