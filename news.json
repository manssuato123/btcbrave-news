But a new update for Assassin's Creed Shadows will let you twist the weapon, elbow the enemy in the face, and then stab them again in the head. It's pretty gnarly, and it's part of title update 1.1.7, which is planned to start arriving December 16. On the Ubisoft website, the patch notes highlight the bloody new finishers, saying they \"bring more flair to your encounters.\" The official Assassin's Creed account on YouTube shared a video--seen below--showcasing the gruesome maneuvers for Naoe and Yasuke. The new update also brings quite a few improvements to the recently released Switch 2 edition of Assassin's Creed Shadows. Ubisoft says that frame rate issues have been addressed, along with \"various visual issues.\" However, this title update will come a day later, December 17, on Switch 2.

For anyone unaware, Kingmakers is an action-strategy game set in medieval times that allows players to use AK-47s, grenade launchers, and attack helicopters in battle. The game is developed by Redemption Road Games and published by tinyBuild. It was due to launch in October this year before being delayed indefinitely due to its \"incredibly ambitious\" setup. Kingmakers is among the top five most-wishlisted games on Steam. So far, it's only been announced for PC. Deadline reported that Netflix bought a movie pitch for the game, with writer Christopher MacBride (Flashback, The Conspiracy) attached to write the script. The report added that Stranger Things director Shawn Levy's production company, 21 Laps, is producing the Kingsmakers movie, while Story Kitchen's Dmitri M. Johnson, Michael Lawrence Goldberg, and Timothy L. Stevenson are also producing. Story Kitchen is also behind the Sonic movie series, along with the upcoming Tomb Raider and Life is Strange TV shows, among other gaming projects. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

In the end, Bungie chose $40, the same price as Arc Raiders. Buying Marathon provides \"full access to the game,\" along with its free updates, including new maps, Runner shells, events, and other content. Season 1 will introduce UESC Marathon's Cryo Archive, Bungie said. \"We also want to ensure you are logging in because you love the game, not from fear of missing out--so Marathon's Rewards Passes will not expire, and you’ll be able purchase and unlock prior Passes,\" Bungie said, modeling what other games, like Halo Infinite, have done with their own battle passes.

Anime skins are clearly popular, so it makes sense that more are coming. Next up is Bleach, the beloved show that began in the 2004, and which is currently running a revival series to finish telling the manga's story, called Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War. This first collaboration with Bleach will, according to posters that have been spotted in the wild, include four skins: Ichigo Kurosaki, Rukia Kuchiki, Orihime Inoue, and Uryu Ishida. And presumably at least one gigantic sword. Message received.I can feel it.Something is coming… pic.twitter.com/wpifS7zyvD — Fortnite (@Fortnite) December 14, 2025 We have no further details about the collab, which has only been teased by Epic rather than fully revealed. But since this collab will be released during the holidays and Fortnite's Winterfest event, there's a decent chance there will be some kind of Bleach component added to Battle Royale, Blitz Royale, or Reload, since Fortnite has included tons of mythic weapons and powers based on anime series in the past--particularly at the end of the year.

That checks out, per the free DLC's name, but the developer added the desire \"to make it a bit bigger.\" As such, the update is arriving for the festive season, with the Megabonk account on X promising a \"new meta.\" Megabonk launched in September, sharing similarities with Vampire Survivors and Risk of Rain. It's a roguelike game where you do your best to survive against an onslaught of enemies on randomized maps. While doing so, you level up and find various items. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

McConaughey is also lending his voice to Exodus, an upcoming sci-fi title from BioWare veterans at Archetype Entertainment. But given the timing of McConaughey's new deal, Archetype co-founder Chad Robertson wants players to know that the actor really is lending his voice to the game. \"Everything that's in Exodus ... is bespoke VO recording just for us,\" Robertson told Eurogamer. \"He has a completely separate deal of his own design that he's worked out with Elevenlabs, which happens to be one of the most prominent, AI voice-generation tools, that is being used by other video game companies. Such that people could leverage his voice in non-bespoke VO sessions in a different way. He has a bunch of really strict rules around how it could be used.\" Robertson went on to note that Archetype is not using generative AI in the production of its game, but added that using it in the future is a possibility under the right circumstances.

Season 2 will now premiere on December 16 at 6 PM PT / 9 PM ET. It was previously set to debut at 12 AM PT / 3 AM ET on December 17. Whether or not the scheduling update for the Season 2 premiere has any effect on when the following seven episodes will arrive is unknown. Well, well, looks like Christmas came early on Sphere.
