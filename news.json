    "description": "Nintendo Switch 2 Wheel Set for Joy-Con 2 $20 (was $25) See at Amazon See at Target If you're one of the many holiday shoppers who took advantage of last week's Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle promotion, you should check out this week's deal on the racing wheel attachment set. Nintendo's official Joy-Con 2 Wheel Set is on sale for only $20 (was $25) at Amazon and Target. The deal price was $21.49 earlier this week, so this deal is a bit better as of December 11. Designed for playing Mario Kart World with motion controls, the two-pack of steering wheels launched alongside the Switch 2 console in June. Nintendo Switch 2 Wheel Set for Joy-Con 2 $20 (was $25) The official Nintendo Switch 2 Wheel Set comes with one light blue and one red attachment that match the color scheme of the Joy-Con 2 controllers. The textured grips are nicer than a lot of third-party wheels and Nintendo's attachments from the Nintendo Wii era. Just like the Switch 2 console itself, the first-party steering wheels have magnetic connectors for the controllers. Large shoulder buttons (SL and SR) are built into the back of each wheel. See at Amazon See at Target Considering the popularity of the Mario Kart World bundle deal, which ended on Sunday, it wouldn't be surprising if Amazon and Target sold out of this deal. Last week, Amazon sold out of all three of Hori's new Mario Kart World-themed Joy-Con 2 wheel attachments. Themed around Mario, Peach, and Yoshi, the officially licensed $15 wheels launched December 5. Amazon lists all three as \"temporarily out of stock,\" but you can place orders for the Mario and Peach editions. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Marseille's mClassic graphics upscaler is available in three models: Switch, Retro, and Original. The Retro and Switch Editions are discounted to only $64.32 (was $100), while the Original Edition is $84.88. The Retro and Switch Editions were $75 during Black Friday, so the current deals on those are considerably better. The mClassic Switch Edition is tailored around upscaling the visuals on Switch and other widescreen platforms like Steam Deck, Wii, Xbox 360, and PS3. The mClassic Retro Edition, meanwhile, is designed for gamers who want to improve the visual experience of older games originally designed for 4:3 aspect ratio displays when playing on modern HD and 4K TVs. The Switch and Retro Editions launched earlier this year. They have the same core enhancement modes as the Original Edition while also offering two new visual modes geared toward Switch/Steam Deck or retro gaming, depending on which model you pick.

    "description": "Rockstar Games has released a new statement regarding the situation surrounding the fired workers in the UK and internationally, once again claiming the 30+ staffers were let go not because they were trying to form a union, but because they were breaching company policy. Specifically, Rockstar Games told GameSpot that the action was taken against the workers because they were discussing \"specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles\" and other \"confidential information\" in a public forum. Rockstar said this was \"in breach of company policy and their legal obligations.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "As it's routinely done with previous games in the series, The Pokemon Company is giving away a variety of freebies for Pokemon Legends: Z-A. These in-game goodies range from helpful items to elusive Mega Stones that can't otherwise be acquired, making it worthwhile to snag them while you can. Most of the free items can be downloaded via Mystery Gift, a function that you'll automatically unlock after the first time you speak with Mable at the Pokemon Research Lab, roughly one hour into the adventure. However, the freebies are typically only available for a limited time, so you'll want to claim them as soon as possible. Here's a roundup of all the free Mystery Gifts available right now for Pokemon Legends: Z-A, along with instructions on how to claim each of them. With the launch of the game's Mega Dimension DLC, more gift distributions will likely happen in the future, so check back often to make sure you don't miss any freebies.

    "description": "For the past two decades, the Call of Duty titles have almost always been the US's top-selling games of the year. But it looks like Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is experiencing a marked decline in sales from its predecessor, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. According to GamesIndustry.biz, Alinea Analytics' data indicates that Black Ops 7 sold 401,000 copies on Steam in the first 26 days after its launch. By comparison, Black Ops 6 sold 2.3 million copies in the same time period in 2024. Call of Duty games have historically sold fewer copies on Steam than on consoles, and Black Ops 6 and 7 were both included with PC Game Pass. But that doesn't account for why the latter had such a dramatic decline. Video Game Insights also shared data that suggests Black Ops 7's daily active users dropped to 18 million in November 2025, down from 36 million DAU in December 2024. Going back to Modern Warfare in 2022, concurrent users on Steam had been on a steady decline from 500,000 in early 2023 before briefly rebounding to over 300,000 players for Black Ops 6. Currently, Black Ops 7 is estimated to have a concurrent count between 50,000 and 100,000 players on Steam. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

For now, Bethesda's Todd Howard is keeping the company's plans close to his vest, but he has indicated there's more happening with Fallout than any other Bethesda property at the moment. \"We've had a long-term plan for Fallout, and so I wish I could talk about all those today,\" Howard told IGN. \"I'll just say this, it's the franchise that we're doing the most in right now.\" Howard also indicated that the success of Prime Video's Fallout TV series hasn't altered those plans or caused Bethesda to move up its timetable.

    "description": "The wait for The Elder Scrolls 6 has been long, and fans are eager for any sign of progress--and don't expect any sort of announcement this holiday season. However, that excitement only grew when Bethesda released a live-action comedy trailer to celebrate Skyrim's sudden launch on the Nintendo Switch 2. The trailer features a mischievous Santa and two elves, and at first glance, it seems like simple holiday fun. But the numbers shown on the elves' character screen quickly caught the community's attention. The reason: One elf's speech skill jumps to 27, while their overall level is shown moving toward 20. Some fans believe these numbers are a deliberate hint that The Elder Scrolls 6 is planned for 2027. Supporters of the theory argue that the numbers are too specific to be random, while others think people may be reading too much into a random number. Still, because Bethesda rarely shares direct updates about the game, even small details like this can spark big debates. \"This honestly might be the best piece of evidence we have for a release date,\" one fan said. \"Those are very specific numbers, and I don't think they would use those numbers by accident.\" Continue Reading at GameSpot",
