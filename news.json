Out of the trending topics--which aren't ranked in any particular order--US YouTube viewers devoured any content related to the Switch 2 console, Roblox, and the RPG-strategy game Cookie Run Kingdom. Other topics of interest in the US included KPop Demon Hunters, Labubu collectible dolls, and the hit anime series Blue Lock. Roblox user-generated experiences and the Switch 2 continued to be popular topics on YouTube worldwide, especially in countries such as Korea, Germany, Mexico, France, Japan, and the United Kingdom. YouTube says that it determined the top trends for the US and other regions through \"a variety of signals,\" including views, uploads, and creator activity around the topics. Only the topics that were determined to have had conspicuous popularity this year--either because they were new to 2025 or because they saw significant increases in their user-interest metrics--were eligible for the list.

On Switch 2, Metroid Prime 4 comes in at an estimated 31.6GB, while the original Switch version only takes up 26.3GB, per the Nintendo Store. Intriguingly, though, the eShop accessed via Switch 2 showcases the Switch edition as taking up 28.9GB. Regardless, it makes sense Metroid Prime 4 has a bigger download size on Switch 2, since the game offers 4K visuals in quality mode docked and 120fps in performance mode docked.

The hub of all things spooky in the Stranger Things series, this Lego replica is loaded with Easter eggs from all five seasons of the Netflix show and it's now available to preorder for $300. Members of the Lego Insiders rewards program can get their hands on the set early, starting January 1, 2026, and it'll be available globally starting January 4. Anyone who buys the set from the Lego Store from January 1-4 will also receive the 584-piece Lego Icons Stranger Things: WSQK Radio Station set as a free gift, which includes Joyce and Hopper minifigures. Lego Stranger Things: The Creel House (2,593 pieces) $300 | Releases January 4, 2026 Just like the infamous location, the Lego replica of the Creel House features a richly detailed facade and several highly detailed rooms. Alice and Henry's bedrooms, the haunted upstairs hallway, and Vecna's Mind Lair are all part of the build, and other nods to the series include the infamous grandfather clock, Steve's car, the WSQK radio station van, and Will's bike. The mansion can be displayed in its eerie boarded-up state, or you can open it up to examine all the rooms inside. The set comes with 13 minifigures--Eleven, Will, Mike, Lucas, Dustin, Holly, Steve, Nancy, Robin, Jonathan, Max, Mr. Whatsit, and Vecna--and it measures over 11.5 inches high, 20 inches wide, and 7 inches deep after it has been fully constructed. See at Lego Store Gallery This isn't the first Stranger Things set produced by Lego, and if you're looking to complete the collection, you can pick up a BrickHeadz collection of Mike Wheeler, Dustin Henderson, Lucas Sinclair, and Will Byers buildable figures for $40. The set launched in October, and each figure adapts the Stranger Things character's look and '80s fashion. Stranger Things BrickHeadz See at Lego Store Each blocky figure also comes with a buildable display base to pop them on and accessories like a walkie-talkie for Mike, a headset for Dustin, and a slingshot and binoculars for Lucas.
