These Black Friday deals won't stick around much longer, so if you're interested in adding them to your collection for cheap, swing by Amazon and check them out soon. Superman (4K Blu-ray) $12.49 (was $35) Superman hit theaters in July, and now you can bring it home for $12.49 (was $35). You'll get a 4K Blu-ray and digital copy of the film, plus over 90 minutes of bonus features. This includes behind-the-scenes featurettes like \"Adventures in the Making of Superman\" and an animated short. Both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos are supported, making this the most premium way to enjoy the superhero flick in your home theater. See at Amazon F1: The Movie (4K Blu-ray) $12.49 (was $30) Starring Brad Pitt and directed by Joseph Kosinski, director of Top Gun: Maverick, F1: The Movie earned high praise for its impressive visuals and special effects--if you're a racing fan, it's certainly worth checking out. Beyond 4K Blu-ray and digital copies of the movie, you'll get special features such as the \"Inside the F1: The Movie Table Read\" and a look at sets and locations from around the world. Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos are once again supported. See at Amazon Jurassic World Rebirth: Collector's Edition (4K Blu-ray) $13.49 (was $30) This Collector's Edition comes with 4K Blu-ray, standard Blu-ray, and digital copies of Jurassic World Rebirth. Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos are supported, and you'll find over an hour of bonus features packed into the bundle. This includes deleted scenes, an alternate opening, and a making-of documentary, among plenty of other featurettes. Starring Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali, it earned mixed reviews (but no doubt it's a fun summer blockbuster). See at Amazon While the 4K Blu-ray deals are arguably the most enticing, two of the above films are also available for cheap on standard Blu-ray. The Superman Blu-ray is $9.49 (was $30), and it gets you all the same bonus features as its fancier 4K sibling. It also supports Dolby Atmos. F1: The Movie on Blu-ray is also $9.49 (was $25), once again getting you the same bonus features as the 4K edition, plus support for Dolby Atmos. But since the 4K version of both these films is just a few bucks more expensive, most shoppers will probably find them to be the better option than standard Blu-ray. And if you want to add even more movies to your home theater, check out the Criterion Collection Black Friday Sale at Amazon, which is offering 50% discounts on hundreds of iconic films.

    "title": "The Avengers Helicarrier Lego Model Is 50% Off At Walmart",
    "description": "Lego Marvel: The Avengers Helicarrier (509 Pieces) $40 (was $80) | Black Friday Deal See at Walmart Walmart is holding a big Black Friday sale on Lego, and for Marvel fans, now is a great time to pick up the Lego Marvel Avengers Helicarrier at 50% off. On sale for $40 (was $80), this 509-piece model is a compact and detailed replica of the aerial base of operations used by Nick Fury and the Avengers in the Marvel movies. Lego Marvel: The Avengers Helicarrier (509 Pieces) $40 (was $80) | Black Friday Deal Measuring over 13 inches long and 8.5 inches wide, the helicarrier is designed as a display piece. It can be mounted on a sturdy base after assembly, and it features numerous screen-accurate details in Lego form. The runway features pieces resembling Quinjets, engines powered by Tony Stark's Arc Reactor technology, a series of propellers to keep the vessel airborne, and a command deck overseeing all operations. This makes for a quick lunchtime build, and like other Lego sets, you'll find the instruction booklet included. You can also use the Lego Builder app for an interactive walkthrough of each step. See at Walmart Another notable Lego Marvel deal at Walmart is the Marvel Logo and Minifigures set. This 931-piece set is priced at $80 (was $100) for Black Friday, and it's a tribute to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Not only can you build the iconic Marvel logo, but you can also make several minifigures spring out from secret compartments. Amazon is also price-matching this set, in case it sells out at Walmart. Walmart has also discounted several other popular Star Wars Lego vehicles. The 630-piece Executor Super Star Destroyer is on sale for $40 (was $70), Princess Leia's transport vessel Tantive IV has been discounted by 50% to $40, and you can pair that with the diorama piece Boarding the Tantive IV for $38.49 (was $55). The 502-piece set is being retired soon, so this is a nice deal on a set that accurately recreates the opening scene from A New Hope. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

Restocked in October after being sold out for months, the Gift Bundle comes with everything found in the regular Spider-Man Bundle (sold out) as well as a Collector Booster Pack, which is selling for $43 on its own. The Gift Bundle also comes with nine standard Boosters (14 cards each), an Alternate-Art Foil Promo Card, and numerous accessories, including a Spider-Man themed card storage box. Speaking of Collector Booster Packs, Amazon has also slashed the price of the MTG Spider-Man Collector Booster Box by over $100 during its sale. The discount brings the price for 12 Collector Booster Packs to roughly $29 each. These are eye-catching deals for Magic: The Gathering products that launched two months ago, but the best MTG deal at Amazon is probably the Final Fantasy Play Booster Box for $130 (was $210), which is by far the best deal yet for the exceedingly popular MTG set.

    "description": "For the last couple of years, the Epic Games Store has given away free games every week through its PC storefront. With the company having launched its own mobile store, it has also started a second free games program on iOS and Android devices, kicking things off with a curated library of titles and weekly freebies. The app also features mobile versions of Fortnite, Fall Guys, and Rocket League Sideswipe. To access these games you will need to create a free Epic account and install the free Epic Games Store mobile app and log in with your account, but once you do, you can start claiming your free games every Thursday through it. One other thing to note is that Android users can access the app via Android-based emulation devices like Retroid Pocket, as they aren't limited to just smartphone and tablets. Download the Epic Games Store Mobile app For now, only iOS users in the European Union can install the app, but the app is available worldwide to Android device users and they have a wider selection of games to choose from in comparison. Like its PC counterpart, you'll have one week to grab each game that's offered. Here's a closer look at what you can grab this week, and what the current mobile games library has to offer. You can also explore what the free PC games are this week on the Epic Games Store. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Borderlands 4 for PS5 / Xbox Series X $35 (was $70) See at Amazon See at GameStop Borderlands 4 for Nintendo Switch 2 $55 (was $70) | Release Date TBA Preorder at Target Preorder at Amazon If you haven't picked up a copy of Borderlands 4, you can score an incredible deal at Amazon and GameStop for Black Friday. Borderlands 4 is on sale for only $35 just two months after its release. The 50% discount is for the physical edition on PS5 and Xbox Series X. This deal first popped up today (November 27) at GameStop, and Amazon matched it shortly after. Amazon has sold out of the PS5 edition once already, so this deal might not be available after today. Borderlands 4 for PS5 / Xbox Series X $35 (was $70) While previous Borderlands games were primarily set on the planet of Pandora--Borderlands 3 expanded on this with several more planets to visit--Borderlands 4 takes place on the world of Kairos, giving players free rein to cause some chaos as they take on the forces of the Timekeeper. Just like its predecessors, the key goal here is to take control of one of four unique Vault Hunters, grow their skills, and strengthen them further by finding powerful weapons and gear. It's a formula that has been present since the original Borderlands game, but in Borderlands 4, that gameplay has been fine-tuned to its best and enhanced with quality-of-life features. PS5 -- $35 ($70) Xbox Series X -- $35 ($70) See at Amazon See at GameStop Borderlands 4 for Nintendo Switch 2 $55 (was $70) | Release Date TBA The Nintendo Switch 2 port of Borderlands 4 was originally slated for October 3, just a few weeks after the game's September 1 launch on other platforms. But then about a week before launch day, Gearbox announced an indefinite delay to polish the experience on Switch 2. If you're planning on buying Borderlands 4 for Nintendo Switch 2, it makes sense to secure a preorder right now. Target has slashed $15 from the price. Amazon was matching this offer but sold out fast. Keep in mind this is a Game-Key Card, so you will need to download Borderlands 4 from the eShop after loading the cartridge into your console for the first time.
