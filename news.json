Skyrim continues to conquer every platform imaginable, and this time it's specifically 2021's Skyrim Anniversary Edition that's available on Nintendo's new console. This new version of the game does come with a few additional bells and whistles not found in the original Switch version, namely Joy-Con 2 mouse-control support. It also sports improved load times and performance in addition to features found in the original Switch version of Skyrim, like Legend of Zelda Amiibo support, Zelda-themed items, and motion controls.

Those who don't already own any version of Skyrim on Switch can buy it on Switch 2 for $60. Owners of the non-Anniversary Edition of Skyrim on Switch can upgrade to the Anniversary Edition for $20 and then receive the Switch 2 version for free.

    "description": "Nintendo Switch 2 Wheel Set for Joy-Con 2 $21.49 (was $25) See at Amazon See at Target If you're one of the many holiday shoppers who took advantage of last week's Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle promotion, you should check out this week's deal on the racing wheel attachment set. Nintendo's official Joy-Con 2 Wheel Set is on sale for $21.49 (was $25) at Amazon and Target. Deals on first-party Nintendo accessories are uncommon, so even though you're only saving $3.50, it's still a noteworthy deal. Designed for playing Mario Kart World with motion controls, the two-pack of steering wheels launched alongside the Switch 2 console in June. Nintendo Switch 2 Wheel Set for Joy-Con 2 $21.49 (was $25) The official Nintendo Switch 2 Wheel Set comes with one light blue and one red attachment that match the color scheme of the Joy-Con 2 controllers. The textured grips are nicer than a lot of third-party wheels and Nintendo's attachments from the Nintendo Wii era. Just like the Switch 2 console itself, the first-party steering wheels have magnetic connectors for the controllers. Large shoulder buttons (SL and SR) are built into the back of each wheel. See at Amazon See at Target Considering the popularity of the Mario Kart World bundle deal, which ended on Sunday, it wouldn't be surprising if Amazon and Target sold out of this deal. Last week, Amazon sold out of all three of Hori's new Mario Kart World-themed Joy-Con 2 wheel attachments. Themed around Mario, Peach, and Yoshi, the officially licensed $15 wheels launched December 5. Amazon lists all three as \"temporarily out of stock.\" For a larger Switch 2 racing wheel, check out the recently released Joy-Con 2 accessory by Numskull. Officially licensed by Nintendo, Numskull's attachment is table-mounted and has slots for both controllers. It launched for $30, but Amazon has since raised the price to $33.83.

Bloomberg's Jason Schreier broke the story about Gallagher and Horton on Bluesky. According to Schreier, the duo will start their own studio under the Take-Two umbrella. However, there are currently no details about any games that they're working on. Schreier previously reported that Take-Two came close to reviving the Perfect Dark reboot. However, the deal reportedly fell apart over which company would own the rights for the franchise. Regardless, it seems that both Gallagher and Horton made an impression on Take-Two that led to them being hired. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "While Stranger Things is wrapping up after an almost decade run on Netflix, that hasn't stopped the Upside Down from seeping into places most wouldn't expect. Microsoft Flight Simulator 24's collab with Stranger Things has arrived today on Steam, cloud, Xbox, and, despite initial pushback, PS5. The crossover is more than skins; it even features Murray Bauman (Brett Gelman) from the original cast as you help the citizens of Hawkins escape the encroaching darkness. \"Enter the world of Netflix’s Stranger Things to help Hawkins, a town under lockdown, heavy patrols, and supernatural threats,\" it reads on the official PlayStation Blog. \"And, if you’re ready to visit Hawkins, Indiana, even after the credits roll on the crew’s last strange adventure, you will be able to explore a highly detailed map and recreation of the town with more than 40 iconic locations made famous by the show.\" Image Credit: SonyPlayers will take to the skies in a Bell UH-1H, also known as the \"Huey\" helicopter, a model primarily used for troop and cargo transport, medical evacuations, and aerial assault during the Vietnam War. In their civilian use, they're usually involved in humanitarian aid efforts, research operations, and search-and-rescue duties. While the expansion is free, players need to make sure their simulator is updated to the latest version of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, visit the in-sim Marketplace, then select the Stranger Things Expansion.

Kai will actually be the subject of the next Lego Pass--buying the pass for 1,400 V-Bucks, or unlocking it via Fortnite Crew, will instantly unlock both the Lego and Fortnite varieties for Kai. Progressing through the pass from there with XP in any Fortnite experience will grant you a number of Ninjago-themed builds that you can use wherever you like in Lego Fortnite Odyssey, or on your home lot in Lego Fortnite Brick Life. The rest of the Ninjago gang will be available in the item shop on Thursday, and you'll be able to buy them individually or in a big bundle that includes all three and their accompanying accessories. Where are Lloyd and Nya, the other two members of the ninja squad from the show? We don't know, but don't count out the possibility they'll be added later--especially since the trailer description teases another major Ninjago update in 2026. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Evidence of a remake or remaster of the fan-favorite Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is solidifying, with a listing from European content-rating board PEGI emerging. According to the PEGI listing, the re-release of the Ubisoft classic is titled Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced, and it unsurprisingly has an 18 adults-only rating for violence, language, and in-game purchases. Ratings are generally a sign that a title's release is imminent. \"Resynced\" is an amusing subtitle for a re-release, most likely referring to the in-universe Animus virtual reality machine that lets the player character experience historical events through an avatar, \"syncing\" them with memories of someone else from that time period. If you really want to make a stretch, \"Resynced\" could be a nautical pun. Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is celebrating its one-year anniversary today, December 9, 2025. Below, we look back at how it uniquely translated the adventurous and comedic spirit of the original movies in video game form. There are several expectations that come with an Indiana Jones video game--it's a legacy franchise and a known quantity, having chugged along across various media since the franchise's inception in 1981. Among the checklist items for any Indy game are whip-swinging traversal, puzzle-solving in exotic locales, and fascist-punching action. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle certainly has all of the expected elements, but studio MachineGames went far beyond what anyone thought an Indiana Jones video game could be. In a post-Uncharted world, it would be hard to blame a AAA studio if it just followed Naughty Dog's cinematic game formula, made Indiana Jones basically Nathan Drake with a fedora, and called it a day with little shame.

Nintendo started rolling out the new system updates for Switch and Switch 2 yesterday, December 8. Both patch notes are the same: \"General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.\" This is also the same language from a Switch 2 update in September, and stability patches have been joked about regarding Nintendo for years at this point. However, last month brought a beefier update to Switch 2 and Switch. Nintendo added better visual clarity on the home menu regarding digital and physical games as well as GameChat improvements, for example. The patch did bring about more stability improvements, too.

    "description": "Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is celebrating its one-year anniversary today, December 9, 2025. Below, we examine how it carried the torch of the classic films to create the best new piece of Indy fiction in decades. Indiana Jones is one of the most revered blockbuster stories of the 1980s. Spielberg and Lucas' work on the original trilogy stands alongside Jaws and Star Wars as timeless classics that are worth revisiting regularly. The more recent entries--the Crystal Skull and the Dial of Destiny--do little to live up to the standard that the first three set. But the game Indiana Jones and The Great Circle brings everything about that original trilogy back, like a careful archaeological dig. It's the true successor to one of the original blockbuster trilogies. As we hit The Great Circle's first anniversary, it is clearer than ever that MachineGames accomplished something the film series has struggled to for the last 20 years. The Great Circle feels like the real successor to The Last Crusade, not because it imitates it beat for beat, but because it understands the core ingredients that make an Indiana Jones story timeless. It is a globe-spanning mystery built on discovery and the thrill of pushing deeper into the unknown. It captures the charm of a character who is smart, stubborn, curious, and always one quip away from a bruised rib. Continue Reading at GameSpot",
